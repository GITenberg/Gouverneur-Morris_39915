<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p>Two generations ago the average American
biographer was certainly a marvel of turgid and
aimless verbosity; and the reputations of our
early statesmen have in no way proved their
vitality more clearly than by surviving their
entombment in the pages of the authors who
immediately succeeded them. No one of the
founders of the Constitution has suffered more
in this respect than has he who was perhaps
the most brilliant, although by no means the
greatest, of the whole number,&mdash;Gouverneur
Morris.</p>

<p>Jared Sparks, hitherto Morris's sole biographer,
wrote innumerable volumes on American
history, many of which are still very valuable,
and some of them almost indispensable, to the
student. The value, however, comes wholly
from the matter; Mr. Sparks is not only a
very voluminous writer, but he is also a quite
abnormally dull one. His "Life of Gouverneur
Morris" is typical of most of his work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
He collected with great industry facts about
Mr. Morris, and edited a large number of his
letters and state papers, with numerous selections,
not always well chosen, from his Diary.
Other merits the book has none, and it has
one or two marked faults. He failed to understand
that a biographer's duties are not
necessarily identical with those of a professional
eulogist; but for this he is hardly to blame, as
all our writers then seemed to think it necessary
to shower indiscriminate praise on every
dead American&mdash;whether author, soldier,
politician, or what not&mdash;save only Benedict
Arnold. He was funnily unconscious of his
own prolix dullness; and actually makes profuse
apologies for introducing extracts from
Morris's bright, interesting writings into his
own drearily platitudinous pages, hoping that
"candor and justice" will make his readers pardon
the "negligence" and "defects of style,"
which the extracts contain. He could not resist
the temptation now and then to improve Morris's
English, and to soften down, or omit anything
that he deemed either improper or beneath
the stilted "dignity" of history. For example,
Morris states that Marie Antoinette, when pursued
by the Parisian fishwives, fled from her
bed "in her shift and petticoat, with her stockings
in her hand;" such particularity struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Mr. Sparks as shockingly coarse, and with much
refinement he replaced the whole phrase by
"in her undress." An oath he would not permit
to sully his pages on any terms; thus when
Morris wrote that Pennsylvania would find Sir
Henry Clinton "a most damnable physician,"
Mr. Sparks simply left out the offending sentence
altogether. This kind of thing he did
again and again.</p>

<p>Still he gives almost all of Morris's writings
that are of political interest. It is, however,
greatly to be desired that we should have a
much more complete edition of his letters and
Diary, on account of the extremely interesting
descriptions they contain of the social life of the
period, both in America and in Europe. As
regards his public career, and his views and
writings on public subjects, we already have
ample material, much of which has appeared
since Sparks's biography was written, and some
of which is here presented for the first time.</p>

<p>Morris's speeches in the Constitutional Convention
have been preserved, in summarized
form, by Madison in his "Debates:" of these, of
course, Sparks was necessarily ignorant. Miss
Annie Carey Morris has written two articles in
"Scribner's Magazine" for January and February,
1887, on her grandfather's life in Paris
during the French Revolution, giving some new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
and interesting details. A good article appeared
in "Macmillan's Magazine" for November,
1885, the writer evidently having been
attracted to the subject by the way in which
Taine made Morris's writings a basis for so
much of his own great work on the Revolution.
Decidedly the best piece upon Morris that has
yet been written, however, is the admirable
sketch by Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge in the "Atlantic
Monthly" for April, 1886.</p>

<p>My thanks are especially due the Hon. John
Jay for furnishing me many valuable letters,
hitherto unpublished, of both Jay and Morris;
and for giving me additional information about
Morris's private life, and other matters. All
the letters here quoted that are not given by
Sparks are to be found either in the Jay MSS.
or the Pickering MSS. Mr. Jay also furnished
me with the account of the way in which Louis
Philippe was finally persuaded to pay the debt
he owed Morris.</p>

<h3>HIS YOUTH: COLONIAL NEW YORK.</h3>

<p>When, on January 31, 1752, Gouverneur
Morris was born in the family manor-house at
Morrisania, on the lands where his forefathers
had dwelt for three generations, New York colony
contained only some eighty thousand inhabitants,
of whom twelve thousand were
blacks. New York city was a thriving little
trading town, whose people in summer suffered
much from the mosquitoes that came back with
the cows when they were driven home at nightfall
for milking; while from among the locusts
and water-beeches that lined the pleasant, quiet
streets, the tree frogs sang so shrilly through
the long, hot evenings that a man in speaking
could hardly make himself heard.</p>

<p>Gouverneur Morris belonged by birth to
that powerful landed aristocracy whose rule
was known by New York alone among all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
northern colonies. His great-grandfather, who
had served in the Cromwellian armies, came to
the seaport at the mouth of the Hudson, while
it was still beneath the sway of Holland, and
settled outside of Haerlem, the estate being
invested with manorial privileges by the original
grant of the governor. In the next two generations
the Morrises had played a prominent
part in colonial affairs, both the father and
grandfather of Gouverneur having been on the
bench, and having also been members of the
provincial legislature, where they took the
popular side, and stood up stoutly for the rights
of the Assembly in the wearisome and interminable
conflicts waged by the latter against
the prerogatives of the crown and the powers
of the royal governors. The Morrises were
restless, adventurous men, of erratic temper
and strong intellect; and, with far more than
his share of the family talent and brilliancy,
young Gouverneur also inherited a certain
whimsical streak that ran through his character.
His mother was one of the Huguenot
Gouverneurs, who had been settled in New
York since the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes; and it was perhaps the French blood
in his veins that gave him the alert vivacity
and keen sense of humor that distinguished
him from most of the great Revolutionary
statesmen who were his contemporaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
He was a bright, active boy, fond of shooting
and out-door sports, and was early put to
school at the old Huguenot settlement of New
Rochelle, where the church service was still
sometimes held in French; and he there learned
to speak and write this language almost as
well as he could English. Thence, after the
usual preparatory instruction, he went to King's
College&mdash;now, with altered name and spirit,
Columbia&mdash;in New York.</p>

<p>The years of his childhood were stirring
ones for the colonies; for England was then
waging the greatest and most successful of her
colonial contests with France and Spain for the
possession of eastern North America. Such
contests, with their usual savage accompaniments
in the way of Indian warfare, always
fell with especial weight on New York, whose
border lands were not only claimed, but even
held by the French, and within whose boundaries
lay the great confederacy of the Six Nations,
the most crafty, warlike, and formidable of all
the native races, infinitely more to be dreaded
than the Algonquin tribes with whom the
other colonies had to deal. Nor was this war
any exception to the rule; for battle after battle
was fought on our soil, from the day when,
unassisted, the purely colonial troops of New
York and New England at Lake George destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Baron Dieskau's mixed host of French
regulars, Canadian militia, and Indian allies,
to that still more bloody day when, on the
shores of Lake Champlain, Abercrombie's great
army of British and Americans recoiled before
the fiery genius of Montcalm.</p>

<p>When once the war was ended by the complete
and final overthrow of the French power,
and the definite establishment of English
supremacy along the whole Atlantic seaboard,
the bickering which was always going on between
Great Britain and her American subjects,
and which was but partially suppressed
even when they were forced to join in common
efforts to destroy a common foe, broke out far
more fiercely than ever. While the colonists
were still reaping the aftermath of the contest
in the shape of desolating border warfare
against those Indian tribes who had joined in
the famous conspiracy of Pontiac, the Royal
Parliament passed the Stamp Act, and thereby
began the struggle that ended in the Revolution.</p>

<p>England's treatment of her American subjects
was thoroughly selfish; but that her conduct
towards them was a wonder of tyranny,
will not now be seriously asserted; on the
contrary, she stood decidedly above the general
European standard in such matters, and certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
treated her colonies far better than
France and Spain did theirs; and she herself
had undoubted grounds for complaint in, for
example, the readiness of the Americans to
claim military help in time of danger, together
with their frank reluctance to pay for it. It
was impossible that she should be so far in advance
of the age as to treat her colonists as
equals; they themselves were sometimes quite
as intolerant in their behavior towards men of
a different race, creed, or color. The New England
Puritans lacked only the power, but not
the will, to behave almost as badly towards the
Pennsylvania Quakers as did the Episcopalian
English towards themselves. Yet granting all
this, the fact remains, that in the Revolutionary
War the Americans stood towards the British
as the Protestant peoples stood towards
the Catholic powers in the sixteenth century,
as the Parliamentarians stood towards the
Stewarts in the seventeenth, or as the upholders
of the American Union stood towards
the confederate slave-holders in the nineteenth;
that is, they warred victoriously for the right
in a struggle whose outcome vitally affected
the welfare of the whole human race. They
settled, once for all, that thereafter the people
of English stock should spread at will over
the world's waste spaces, keeping all their old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
liberties and winning new ones; and they took
the first and longest step in establishing the
great principle that thenceforth those Europeans,
who by their strength and daring founded
new states abroad, should be deemed to have
done so for their own profit as freemen, and not
for the benefit of their more timid, lazy, or
contented brethren who stayed behind.</p>

<p>The rulers of Great Britain, and to a large
extent its people, looked upon the American
colonies as existing primarily for the good of
the mother country: they put the harshest restrictions
on American trade in the interests
of British merchants; they discouraged the
spread of the Americans westward; and they
claimed the right to decide for both parties the
proportions in which they should pay their
shares of the common burdens. The English
and Americans were not the subjects of a common
sovereign; for the English were themselves
the sovereigns, the Americans were the
subjects. Whether their yoke bore heavily or
bore lightly, whether it galled or not, mattered
little; it was enough that it was a yoke to warrant
a proud, free people in throwing it off.
We could not thankfully take as a boon part
only of what we felt to be our lawful due.
"We do not claim liberty as a privilege, but
challenge it as a right," said the men of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
York, through their legislature, in 1764; and
all Americans felt with them.</p>

<p>Yet, for all this, the feeling of loyalty was
strong and hard to overcome throughout the
provinces, and especially in New York. The
Assembly wrangled with the royal governor;
the merchants and shipmasters combined to
evade the intolerable harshness of the laws of
trade that tried to make them customers of
England only; the householders bitterly resented
the attempts to quarter troops upon
them; while the soldiers of the garrison were
from time to time involved in brawls with the
lower ranks of the people, especially the sailors,
as the seafaring population was large, and
much given to forcibly releasing men taken
by the press-gang for the British war-ships;
but in spite of everything there was a genuine
sentiment of affection and respect for the
British crown and kingdom. It is perfectly
possible that if British statesmen had shown
less crass and brutal stupidity, if they had
shown even the wise negligence of Walpole,
this feeling of loyalty would have been strong
enough to keep England and America united
until they had learned how to accommodate
themselves to the rapidly changing conditions;
but the chance was lost when once a prince
like George the Third came to the throne. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
has been the fashion to represent this king as
a well meaning, though dull person, whose
good morals and excellent intentions partially
atoned for his mistakes of judgment; but such
a view is curiously false. His private life, it is
true, showed the very admirable but common-place
virtues, as well as the appalling intellectual
littleness, barrenness, and stagnation, of
the average British green-grocer; but in his
public career, instead of rising to the level of
harmless and unimportant mediocrity usually
reached by the sovereigns of the House of
Hanover, he fairly rivaled the Stuarts in his
perfidy, wrongheadedness, political debauchery,
and attempts to destroy free government, and
to replace it by a system of personal despotism.
It needed all the successive blunders both of
himself and of his Tory ministers to reduce the
loyal party in New York to a minority, by
driving the moderate men into the patriotic
or American camp; and even then the loyalist
minority remained large enough to be a formidable
power, and to plunge the embryonic
state into a ferocious civil war, carried on, as in
the Carolinas and Georgia, with even more bitterness
than the contest against the British.</p>

<p>The nature of this loyalist party and the
strength of the conflicting elements can only be
understood after a glance at the many nationalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
that in New York were being blended
into one. The descendants of the old Dutch
inhabitants were still more numerous than those
of any other one race, while the French Huguenots,
who, being of the same Calvinistic faith,
were closely mixed with them, and had been in
the land nearly as long, were also plentiful;
the Scotch and Scotch- or Anglo-Irish, mostly
Presbyterians, came next in point of numbers;
the English, both of Old and New England,
next; there were large bodies of Germans;
and there were also settlements of Gaelic
Highlanders, and some Welsh, Scandinavians,
etc. Just prior to the Revolution there
were in New York city two Episcopalian
churches, three Dutch Reformed, three Presbyterian
(Scotch and Irish), one French, two
German (one Lutheran and one Calvinistic, allied
to the Dutch Reformed); as well as places
of worship for the then insignificant religious
bodies of the Methodists, Baptists (largely
Welsh), Moravians (German), Quakers and
Jews. There was no Roman Catholic church
until after the Revolution; in fact before that
date there were hardly any Roman Catholics
in the colonies, except in Maryland and Pennsylvania,
and in New York they did not acquire
any strength until after the War of 1812.</p>

<p>This mixture of races is very clearly shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
by the ancestry of the half-dozen great men
brought forth by New York during the Revolution.
Of these, one, Alexander Hamilton,
stands in the very first class of American statesmen;
two more, John Jay and Gouverneur
Morris, come close behind him; the others,
Philip Schuyler, Robert Livingston, and George
Clinton, were of lesser, but still of more than
merely local, note. They were all born and
bred on this side of the Atlantic. Hamilton's
father was of Scotch, and his mother of French
Huguenot, descent; Morris came on one side
of English, and on the other of French Huguenot,
stock; Jay, of French Huguenot blood,
had a mother who was Dutch; Schuyler was
purely Dutch; Livingston was Scotch on his
father's, and Dutch on his mother's, side; the
Clintons were of Anglo-Irish origin, but married
into the old Dutch families. In the same
way, it was Herkomer, of German parentage,
who led the New York levies, and fell at their
head in the bloody fight against the Tories and
Indians at Oriskany; it was the Irishman
Montgomery who died leading the New York
troops against Quebec; while yet another of
the few generals allotted to New York by the
Continental Congress was MacDougall, of
Gaelic Scotch descent. The colony was already
developing an ethnic type of its own, quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
distinct from that of England. No American
state of the present day, not even Wisconsin
or Minnesota, shows so many and important
"foreign," or non-English elements, as New
York, and for that matter Pennsylvania and
Delaware, did a century or so ago. In fact, in
New York the English element in the blood
has grown greatly during the past century,
owing to the enormous New England immigration
that took place during its first half;
and the only important addition to the race
conglomerate has been made by the Celtic Irish.
The New England element in New York in
1775 was small and unimportant; on Long
Island, where it was largest, it was mainly
tory or neutral; in the city itself, however, it
was aggressively patriotic.</p>

<p>Recent English writers, and some of our own
as well, have foretold woe to our nation, because
the blood of the Cavalier and the Roundhead
is being diluted with that of "German
boors and Irish cotters." The alarm is needless.
As a matter of fact the majority of the
people of the middle colonies at the time of
the Revolution <i>were</i> the descendants of Dutch
and German boors and Scotch and Irish cotters;
and in a less degree the same was true
of Georgia and the Carolinas. Even in New
England, where the English stock was purest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
there was plenty of other admixture, and two
of her most distinguished Revolutionary families
bore, one the Huguenot name of Bowdoin,
and the other the Irish name of Sullivan.
Indeed, from the very outset, from the days of
Cromwell, there has been a large Irish admixture
in New England. When our people
began their existence as a nation, they already
differed in blood from their ancestral relatives
across the Atlantic much as the latter did
from their forebears beyond the German Ocean;
and on the whole, the immigration since has not
materially changed the race strains in our nationality;
a century back we were even less
homogeneous than we are now. It is no doubt
true that we are in the main an offshoot of the
English stem; and cousins to our kinsfolk of
Britain we perhaps may be; but brothers we
certainly are not.</p>

<p>But the process of assimilating, or as we
should now say, of Americanizing, all foreign
and non-English elements was going on almost
as rapidly a hundred years ago as it is at present.
A young Dutchman or Huguenot felt it
necessary, then, to learn English, precisely as
a young Scandinavian or German does now;
and the churches of the former at the end of
the last century were obliged to adopt English
as the language for their ritual exactly as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
churches of the latter do at the end of this.
The most stirring, energetic, and progressive
life of the colony was English; and all the
young fellows of push and ambition gradually
adopted this as their native language, and then
refused to belong to congregations where the
service was carried on in a less familiar speech.
Accordingly the Dutch Reformed churches
dwindled steadily, while the Episcopalian and
Presbyterian swelled in the same ratio, until
in 1764 the former gained a new and lasting
lease of life by reluctantly adopting the prevailing
tongue; though Dutch was also occasionally
used until forty years later.</p>

<p>In fact, during the century that elapsed between
the final British conquest of the colony
and the Revolution, the New Yorkers&mdash;Dutch,
French, German, Irish, and English&mdash;had
become in the main welded into one people;
they felt alike towards outsiders, having chronic
quarrels with the New England States as well
as with Great Britain, and showing, indeed,
but little more jealous hostility towards the
latter than they did towards Connecticut and
New Hampshire.</p>

<p>The religious differences no longer corresponded
to the differences of language. Half
of the adherents of the Episcopalian Church
were of Dutch or Huguenot blood; the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
ministers of the Dutch Church were of Scotch
parentage; and the Presbyterians included
some of every race. The colonists were all
growing to call themselves Englishmen; when
Mayor Cruger, and a board of aldermen with
names equally Dutch, signed the non-importation
agreement, they prefaced it by stating that they
claimed "their rights as Englishmen." But
though there were no rivalries of race, there
were many and bitter of class and religion, the
different Protestant sects hating one another
with a virulence much surpassing that with
which they now regard even Catholics.</p>

<p>The colony was in government an aristocratic
republic, its constitution modeled on that of
England and similar to it; the power lay in
the hands of certain old and wealthy families,
Dutch and English, and there was a limited
freehold suffrage. The great landed families,
the Livingstons, Van Rennselaers, Schuylers,
Van Cortlandts, Phillipses, Morrises, with their
huge manorial estates, their riches, their absolute
social preëminence and their unquestioned
political headship, formed a proud, polished,
and powerful aristocracy, deep rooted in the
soil; for over a century their sway was unbroken,
save by contests between themselves or
with the royal governor, and they furnished
the colony with military, political, and social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
leaders for generation after generation. They
owned numerous black slaves, and lived in state
and comfort on their broad acres, tenant-farmed,
in the great, roomy manor-houses, with wainscoted
walls and huge fireplaces, and round
about the quaint old gardens, prim and formal
with their box hedges and precise flower beds.
They answered closely to the whig lords of
England, and indeed were often connected with
the ruling orders abroad by blood or marriage;
as an example, Staats Long Morris, Gouverneur's
elder brother, who remained a royalist,
and rose to be a major-general in the British
army, married the Duchess of Gordon. Some
of the manors were so large that they sent
representatives to the Albany legislature, to
sit alongside of those from the towns and
counties.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the great manorial
lords came the rich merchants of New York;
many families, like the Livingstons, the most
prominent of all, had representatives in both
classes. The merchants were somewhat of the
type of Frobisher, Hawkins, Klaesoon, and other
old English and Dutch sea-worthies, who were
equally keen as fighters and traders. They
were shrewd, daring, and prosperous; they were
often their own ship-masters, and during the
incessant wars against the French and Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
went into privateering ventures with even more
zest and spirit than into peaceful trading.
Next came the smaller landed proprietors, who
also possessed considerable local influence; such
was the family of the Clintons. The law, too,
was beginning to take high rank as an honorable
and influential profession.</p>

<p>Most of the gentry were Episcopalians, theirs
being practically the state church, and very
influential and wealthy; some belonged to the
Calvinistic bodies,&mdash;notably the Livingstons,
who were in large part Presbyterians, while certain
of their number were prominent members
of the Dutch congregations. It was from among
the gentry that the little group of New York
revolutionary leaders came; men of singular
purity, courage, and ability, who, if they could
not quite rank with the brilliant Virginians of
that date, nevertheless stood close behind,
alongside of the Massachusetts men and ahead
of those from any other colony; that, too, it
must be kept in mind, at a time when New
York was inferior in wealth and population to
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, or Virginia, and
little, if at all, in advance of Maryland or Connecticut.
The great families also furnished the
leaders of the loyalists during the war; such
were the De Lanceys, whose influence around
the mouth of the Hudson was second to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
none others; and the Johnsons, who, in mansions
that were also castles, held half-feudal,
half-barbaric sway over the valley of the upper
Mohawk, where they were absolute rulers, ready
and willing to wage war on their own account,
relying on their numerous kinsmen, their armed
negro slaves, their trained bands of Gaelic retainers,
and their hosts of savage allies, drawn
from among the dreaded Iroquois.</p>

<p>The bulk of the people were small farmers in
the country, tradesmen and mechanics in the
towns. They were for the most part members
of some of the Calvinistic churches, the great
majority of the whole population belonging to
the Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed congregations.
The farmers were thrifty, set in their
ways, and obstinate; the townsmen thrifty also,
but restless and turbulent. Both farmers and
townsmen were thoroughly independent and
self-respecting, and were gradually getting more
and more political power. They had always
stood tenaciously by their rights, from the days
of the early Stuart governors, who had complained
loudly of the "Dutch Republicans."
But they were narrow, jealous of each other, as
well as of outsiders, and slow to act together.</p>

<p>The political struggles were very bitter.
The great families, under whose banners they
were carried on, though all intermarried, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
divided by keen rivalries into opposing camps.
Yet they joined in dreading too great an extension
of democracy; and in return were suspected
by the masses, who grumblingly followed
their lead, of hostility to the popular
cause. The Episcopalians, though greatly in
the minority, possessed most power, and harassed
in every way they dared the dissenting
sects, especially the Presbyterians&mdash;for
the Dutch Reformed and Huguenot churches
had certain rights guaranteed them by treaty.
The Episcopalian clergy were royalists to a
man, and it was in their congregations that the
main strength of the Tories lay, although these
also contained many who became the stanchest
of patriots. King's College was controlled by
trustees of this faith. They were busy trying
to turn it into a diminutive imitation of Oxford,
and did their best to make it, in its own
small way, almost as much a perverse miracle
of backward and invariable wrong-headedness
as was its great model. Its president, when the
Revolution broke out, was a real old wine-bibbing
Tory parson, devoted to every worn-out
theory that inculcated humble obedience to
church and crown; and he was most summarily
expelled by the mob.</p>

<p>Some important political consequences arose
from the fact that the mass of the people belonged
to some one or other of the branches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the Calvinistic faith&mdash;of all faiths the most republican
in its tendencies. They were strongly
inclined to put their republican principles into
practice as well in state as in church; they
tended towards hostility to the crown, and were
strenuous in their opposition to the extension of
the Episcopal power, always threatened by
some English statesmen; their cry was against
"the King and the Bishops." It is worth noting
that the Episcopalian churches were shut
up when the Revolution broke out, and were
reopened when the British troops occupied the
city. The Calvinistic churches, on the contrary,
which sided with the revolutionists, were
shut when the British came into New York,
were plundered by the troops, and were not reopened
until after the evacuation.</p>

<p>Thus three parties developed, although the
third, destined to overwhelm the others, had
not yet come to the front. The first consisted
of the royalists, or monarchists, the men who
believed that power came from above, from the
king and the bishops, and who were aristocratic
in their sympathies; who were Americans
only secondarily, and who stood by their
order against their country. This party contained
many of the great manorial families and
also of the merchants; and in certain places, as
in Staten Island, the east end of Long Island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the upper valley of the Mohawk, and part of
Westchester County, the influence of the upper
classes combined with the jealousy and ignorance
of large sections of the lower, to give it a
clear majority of the whole population. The
second party was headed by the great families
of Whig or liberal sympathies, who, when the
split came, stood by their country, although
only very moderate republicans; and it held
also in its ranks the mass of moderate men, who
wished freedom, were resolute in defense of
their rights, and had republican leanings, but
who also appreciated the good in the system
under which they were living. Finally came
the extremists, the men of strong republican
tendencies, whose delight it was to toast Pym,
Hampden, and the regicides. These were led by
the agitators in the towns, and were energetic
and active, but were unable to effect anything
until the blunders of the British ministers threw
the moderate men over to their side. They furnished
none of the greater revolutionary leaders
in New York, though the Clintons came
near the line that divided them from the second
party.</p>

<p>The last political contest carried on under
the crown occurred in 1768, the year in which
Morris graduated from college, when the last
colonial legislature was elected. It reminds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
us of our own days when we read of the fears
entertained of the solid German vote, and of
the hostility to the Irish, who were hated and
sneered at as "beggars" by the English party
and the rich Episcopalians. The Irish of those
days, however, were Presbyterians, and in blood
more English than Gaelic. St. Patrick's Day
was celebrated then as now, by public processions,
as well as otherwise; but when, for instance,
on March 17, 1766, the Irish residents
of New York celebrated the day by a dinner,
they gave certain toasts that would sound
strangely in the ears of Milesian patriots of the
present time, for they included "The Protestant
Interest," and "King William, of glorious,
pious, and immortal memory."</p>

<p>The royalist or conservative side in this contest
in 1768 was led by the De Lanceys, their
main support being drawn from among the
Episcopalians, and most of the larger merchants
helping them. The Whigs, including
those with republican leanings, followed the
Livingstons, and were drawn mainly from the
Presbyterian and other Calvinistic congregations.
The moderate men on this occasion
went with the De Lanceys, and gave them the
victory. In consequence the colonial legislature
was conservative and loyal in tone, and anti-republican,
although not ultra-tory, as a whole;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and thus when the revolutionary outbreak began
it went much slower than was satisfactory to the
patriot party, and its actions were finally set
aside by the people.</p>

<p>When Morris graduated from college, as
mentioned above, he was not yet seventeen
years old. His college career was like that of
any other bright, quick boy, without over much
industry or a passion for learning. For mathematics
he possessed a genuine taste; he was particularly
fond of Shakespeare; and even thus
early he showed great skill in discussion and
much power of argument. He made the oration,
or graduating address, of his class, choosing
for the subject "Wit and Beauty;" it was by
no means a noteworthy effort, and was couched
in the dreadful Johnsonian English of the
period. A little later, when he took his master's
degree, he again delivered an oration,&mdash;this
time on "Love." In point of style this
second speech was as bad as the first, disfigured
by cumbrous Latinisms and a hopeless use of
the superlative; but there were one or two
good ideas in it.</p>

<p>As soon as he graduated, he set to work to
study law, deciding on this profession at once
as being best suited for an active, hopeful, ambitious
young man of his social standing and
small fortune, who was perfectly self-confident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and conscious of his own powers. He soon
became interested in his studies, and followed
them with great patience, working hard and
mastering both principles and details with ease.
He was licensed to practice as an attorney in
1771, just three years after another young man,
destined to stand as his equal in the list of New
York's four or five noted statesmen, John Jay,
had likewise been admitted to the bar; and
among the very few cases in which Morris was
engaged of which the record has been kept is
one concerning a contested election, in which
he was pitted against Jay, and bore himself
well.</p>

<p>Before this, and while not yet of age, he had
already begun to play a part in public affairs.
The colony had been run in debt during the
French and Indian wars, and a bill was brought
forward in the New York Assembly to provide
for this by raising money through the issue of
interest-bearing bills of credit. The people, individually,
were largely in debt, and hailed the
proposal with much satisfaction, on the theory
that it would "make money more plenty;"
our revolutionary forefathers being unfortunately
not much wiser or more honest in their
ways of looking at the public finances than we
ourselves, in spite of our state repudiators, national
greenbackers, and dishonest silver men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Morris attacked the bill very forcibly, and
with good effect, opposing any issue of paper
money, which could bring no absolute relief,
but merely a worse catastrophe of bankruptcy
in the end; he pointed out that it was nothing
but a mischievous pretense for putting off the
date of a payment that would have to be met
anyhow, and that ought rather to be met at once
with honest money gathered from the resources
of the province. He showed the bad effects
such a system of artificial credit would have on
private individuals, the farmers and tradesmen,
by encouraging them to speculate and go deeper
into debt; and he criticised unsparingly the
attitude of the majority of his fellow-citizens
in wishing such a measure of relief, not only
for their short-sighted folly, but also for their
criminal and selfish dishonesty in trying to
procure a temporary benefit for themselves at
the lasting expense of the community; finally
he strongly advised them to bear with patience
small evils in the present rather than to remedy
them by inflicting infinitely greater ones on
themselves and their descendants in the future.</p>

<p>At the law he did very well, having the
advantages of his family name, and of his own
fine personal appearance. He was utterly
devoid of embarrassment, and his perfect self-assurance
and freedom from any timidity or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
sense of inferiority left his manner without the
least tinge of awkwardness, and gave clear
ground for his talents and ambition to make
their mark.</p>

<p>However, hardworking and devoted to his
profession though he was, he had the true
family restlessness and craving for excitement,
and soon after he was admitted to the bar, he
began to long for foreign travel, as was natural
enough in a young provincial gentleman of his
breeding and education. In a letter to an
old friend (William Smith, a man of learning,
the historian of the colony, and afterwards its
chief justice), in whose office he had studied
law, he asks advice in the matter, and gives
as his reasons for wishing to make the trip
the desire "to form my manners and address
by the example of the truly polite, to rub off
in the gay circle a few of the many barbarisms
which characterize a provincial education, and
to curb the vain self-sufficiency which arises
from comparing ourselves with companions who
are inferior to us." He then anticipates the
objections that may be made on the score of
the temptations to which he will be exposed
by saying: "If it be allowed that I have a
<i>taste</i> for pleasure, it may naturally follow that
I shall avoid those low pleasures which abound
on this as well as on the other side of the Atlantic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
As for these poignant joys which are
the lot of the affluent, like Tantalus I may grasp
at them, but they will certainly be out of my
reach." In this last sentence he touches on his
narrow means; and it was on this point that
his old preceptor harped in making his reply,
cunningly instilling into his mind the danger
of neglecting his business, and bringing up the
appalling example of an "Uncle Robin," who,
having made three pleasure trips to England,
"began to figure with thirty thousand pounds,
and did not leave five thousand;" going on
"What! '<i>Virtus post nummos</i>? Curse on inglorious
wealth?' Spare your indignation. I,
too, detest the ignorant miser; but both virtue
and ambition abhor poverty, or they are mad.
Rather imitate your grandfather [who had
stayed in America and prospered] than your
uncle."</p>

<p>The advice may have had its effect; at any
rate Morris stayed at home, and, with an occasional
trip to Philadelphia, got all he could out
of the society of New York, which, little provincial
seaport though it was, was yet a gay
place, gayer then than any other American city
save Charleston, the society consisting of the
higher crown officials, the rich merchants, and
the great landed proprietors. Into this society
Morris, a handsome, high-bred young fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of easy manners and far from puritanical
morals, plunged with a will, his caustic wit
and rather brusque self-assertion making him
both admired and feared. He enjoyed it all
to the full, and in his bright, chatty letters to
his friends pictures himself as working hard,
but gay enough also: "up all night&mdash;balls,
concerts, assemblies&mdash;all of us mad in the
pursuit of pleasure."</p>

<p>But the Revolution was at hand; and both
pleasure and office-work had to give way to
something more important.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>THE OUTBREAK OF THE REVOLUTION: MORRIS
IN THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>During the years immediately preceding
the outbreak of the Revolution, almost all
people were utterly in the dark as to what
their future conduct should be. No responsible
leader thought seriously of separation
from the mother country, and the bulk of the
population were still farther from supposing
such an event to be possible. Indeed it must
be remembered that all through the Revolutionary
War not only was there a minority
actively favorable to the royal cause, but there
was also a minority&mdash;so large that, added to
the preceding, it has been doubted whether it
was not a majority&mdash;that was but lukewarm in
its devotion to the American side, and was kept
even moderately patriotic almost as much by
the excesses of the British troops and blunders
of the British generals and ministers, as by the
valor of our own soldiers, or the skill of our
own statesmen. We can now see clearly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the right of the matter was with the patriotic
party; and it was a great thing for the whole
English-speaking race that that section of it
which was destined to be the most numerous
and powerful should not be cramped and fettered
by the peculiarly galling shackles of
provincial dependency; but all this was not
by any means so clear then as now, and some
of our best citizens thought themselves in honor
bound to take the opposite side,&mdash;though of necessity
those among our most high-minded men,
who were also far-sighted enough to see the true
nature of the struggle, went with the patriots.</p>

<p>That the loyalists of 1776 were wrong is
beyond question; but it is equally beyond
question that they had greater grounds for
believing themselves right than had the men
who tried to break up the Union three quarters
of a century later. That these latter had the
most hearty faith in the justice of their cause
need not be doubted; and he is but a poor
American whose veins do not thrill with pride
as he reads of the deeds of desperate prowess
done by the confederate armies; but it is
most unfair to brand the "tory" of 1776 with
a shame no longer felt to pertain to the "rebel"
of 1860. Still, there is no doubt, not only that
the patriots were right, but also that they were
as a whole superior to the tories; they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the men with a high ideal of freedom, too fond
of liberty, and too self-respecting, to submit to
foreign rule; they included the mass of hard-working,
orderly, and yet high-spirited yeomen
and freeholders. The tories included those of
the gentry who were devoted to aristocratic
principles; the large class of timid and prosperous
people (like the Pennsylvania Quakers);
the many who feared above all things
disorder; also the very lowest sections of the
community, the lazy, thriftless, and vicious,
who hated their progressive neighbors, as in
the Carolinas; and finally the men who were
really principled in favor of a kingly government.</p>

<p>Morris was at first no more sure of his soundings
than were the rest of his companions.
He was a gentleman of old family, and belonged
to the ruling Episcopalian Church. He
was no friend to tyranny, and he was a
thorough American, but he had little faith in
extreme democracy. The Revolution had two
sides; in the northern Atlantic States at least it
was almost as much an uprising of democracy
against aristocracy as it was a contest between
America and England; and the patriotic Americans,
who nevertheless distrusted ultra-democratic
ideas, suffered many misgivings when
they let their love for their country overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
their pride of caste. The "Sons of Liberty,"
a semi-secret society originating among the
merchants, and very powerful in bringing discontent
to a head, now showed signs of degenerating
into a mob; and for mobs Morris, like
other clear-headed men, felt the most profound
dislike and contempt.</p>

<p>Throughout 1774 he took little part in the
various commotions, which kept getting more
and more violent. He was angered by the
English encroachments, and yet was by no means
pleased with the measures taken to repel them.
The gentry, and the moderate men generally,
were at their wits' ends in trying to lead the
rest of the people, and were being pushed on
farther and farther all the time; the leadership,
even of the revolutionary party, still rested in
their hands; but it grew continually less absolute.
Said Morris: "The spirit of the English
constitution has yet a little influence left, and
but a little. The remains of it, however, will
give the wealthy people a superiority this time;
but, would they secure it, they must banish all
schoolmasters and confine all knowledge to
themselves.... The gentry begin to fear this.
Their committee will be appointed; they will
deceive the people, and again forfeit a share of
their confidence. And if these instances of
what with one side is policy, with the other perfidy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
shall continue to increase and become more
frequent, farewell, aristocracy. I see, and see
it with fear and trembling, that if the dispute
with Britain continues, we shall be under the
worst of all possible dominions; we shall be
under the dominion of a riotous mob. It is
the interest of all men, therefore, to seek for
reunion with the parent state." He then goes
on to discuss the terms which will make this
reunion possible, and evidently draws ideas
from sources as diverse as Rousseau and Pitt,
stating, as preliminaries, that when men come
together in society, there must be an implied
contract that "a part of their freedom shall be
given up for the security of the remainder.
But what part? The answer is plain. The
least possible, considering the circumstances
of the society, which constitute what may be
called its political necessity;" and again: "In
every society the members have a right to the
utmost liberty that can be enjoyed consistent
with the general safety;" while he proposes
the rather wild remedy of divorcing the taxing
and the governing powers, giving America the
right to lay her own imposts, and regulate her
internal police, and reserving to Great Britain
that to regulate the trade for the entire empire.</p>

<p>Naturally there was no hope of any compromise
of this sort. The British ministry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
grew more imperious, and the Colonies more
defiant. At last the clash came, and then
Morris's thorough Americanism and inborn
love of freedom and impatience of tyranny overcame
any lingering class jealousy, and he cast
in his lot with his countrymen. Once in, he
was not of the stuff to waver or look back; but
like most other Americans, and like almost all
New Yorkers, he could not for some little time
realize how hopeless it was to try to close the
breach with Great Britain. Hostilities had
gone on for quite a while before even Washington
could bring himself to believe that a
lasting separation was inevitable.</p>

<p>The Assembly, elected as shown in the previous
chapter, at a moment of reaction, was
royalist in tone. It contained several stanch
patriots, but the majority, although unwilling
to back up the British ministers in all their
doings, were still more hostile to the growing
body of republican revolutionists. They
gradually grew wholly out of sympathy with
the people; until the latter at last gave up all
attempts to act through their ordinary representatives,
and set about electing delegates who
should prove more faithful. Thereupon, in
April, 1775, the last colonial legislature adjourned
for all time, and was replaced by successive
bodies more in touch with the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
sentiment of New York; that is, by various
committees, by a convention to elect delegates
to the Continental Congress, and then by the
Provincial Congress. The lists of names in
these bodies show not only how many leading
men certain families contributed, but also how
mixed the lineage of such families was; for
among the numerous Jays, Livingstons, Ludlows,
Van Cortlandts, Roosevelts, Beekmans,
and others of Dutch, English, and Huguenot
ancestry appear names as distinctly German,
Gaelic-Scotch, and Irish, like Hoffman, Mulligan,
MacDougall, Connor.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
To the Provincial Congress, from thenceforth
on the regular governmental body of the colony,
eighty-one delegates were elected, including
Gouverneur Morris from the county of
Westchester, and seventy were present at the
first meeting, which took place on May 22 at
New York. The voting in the Congress was
done by counties, each being alloted a certain
number of votes roughly approximating to its
population.</p>

<p>Lexington had been fought, and the war had
already begun in Massachusetts; but in New
York, though it was ablaze with sympathy for
the insurgent New Englanders, the royal authority
was still nominally unquestioned, and there
had been no collision with the British troops.
Few, if any, of the people of the colony as yet
aimed at more than a redress of their grievances
and the restoration of their rights and liberties;
they had still no idea of cutting loose from
Great Britain. Even such an avowedly popular
and revolutionary body as the Provincial Congress
contained some few out and out tories and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
very many representatives of that timid, wavering
class, which always halts midway in any
course of action, and is ever prone to adopt half-measures,&mdash;a
class which in any crisis works
quite as much harm as the actively vicious, and
is almost as much hated and even more despised
by the energetic men of strong convictions. The
timid good are never an element of strength
in a community; but they have always been
well represented in New York. During the
Revolutionary War it is not probable that
much more than half of her people were ever
in really hearty and active sympathy with the
patriots.</p>

<p>Morris at once took a prominent place in the
Congress, and he showed the national bent of
his mind when he seconded a resolution to the
effect that implicit obedience ought to be rendered
to the Continental Congress in all matters
pertaining to the general regulation of the
associated colonies. The Assembly, however,
was by no means certain how far it would be
well to go; and the majority declined either to
approve or disapprove of the proceedings of the
late Continental Congress. They agreed to subscribe
to the association, and recommended the
same course to their constituents; but added
that they did not believe the latter should be
forced to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Still, with all their doubting and faint-heartedness,
they did set about preparing for resistance,
and for at least the possibility of concerted
action with the other colonies. The first
step, of course, was to provide for raising funds;
this was considered by a committee of which
Morris was a member, and he prepared and
drew up their report. In the state of public
feeling, which was nearly a unit against "taxation
without representation" abroad, but was
the reverse of unanimous as to submitting even
to taxation with representation at home, it was
impossible to raise money by the ordinary
method; indeed, though the mass of active patriots
were willing to sacrifice much, perhaps
all, for the cause, yet there were quite as many
citizens whose patriotism was lukewarm enough
already, and could not stand any additional
chilling. Such people are always willing to
face what may be called a staved-off sacrifice,
however; and promises to pay in the future what
they can, but will not pay in the present, come
under this head. Besides, there would have
been other difficulties in the way, and in fact it
was impossible to raise the amount needed by
direct taxation. Accordingly Morris, in his report
on behalf of the committee, recommended
an issue of paper money, and advised that this
should not be done by the colony itself, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the Continental Congress should strike the
whole sum needed, and apportion the several
shares to the different colonies, each of them
being bound to discharge its own particular
part, and all together to be liable for whatever
any particular colony was unable to pay. This
plan secured a wide credit and circulation to
the currency, and, what was equally desirable,
created throughout the colonies a common interest
and common responsibility on a most important
point, and greatly strengthened the
bonds of their union. Morris even thus early
showed the breadth of his far-seeing patriotism;
he was emphatically an American first, a New
Yorker next; the whole tone of his mind was
thoroughly national. He took the chief part
in urging the adoption of the report, and made
a most telling speech in its favor before the
Assembly, a mixed audience of the prominent
men of the colony being also present. The
report was adopted and forwarded to the Continental
Congress; Morris was felt on all sides
to have already taken his place among the leaders,
and from thenceforth he was placed on almost
every important committee of the Provincial
Congress.</p>

<p>This body kept on its course, corresponding
with the other colonies, exchanging thinly
veiled threats with the Johnsons, the powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Tory over-lords of the upper Mohawk, and preparing
rather feebly for defense, being hampered
by a total lack of funds or credit until
the continental currency was coined. But they
especially busied themselves with a plan of
reconciliation with England; and in fact were
so very cautions and moderate as to be reproached
by their chosen agent in England,
Edmund Burke, for their "scrupulous timidity."
The Congress, by the way, showed some symptoms
of an advance in toleration, at least so far
as the Protestant sects went; for it was opened
and closed by ministers of the Episcopalian,
Dutch Reformed, Presbyterian, Baptist, and
other sects, each in turn; but, as will shortly
be seen, the feeling against Catholics was quite
as narrow-minded and intense as ever. This
was natural enough in colonial days, when
Protestantism and national patriotism were
almost interchangeable terms; for the hereditary
and embittered foes of the Americans, the
French and Spaniards, were all Catholics, and
even many of the Indians were of the same
faith; and undoubtedly the wonderful increase
in the spirit of tolerance shown after the Revolution
was due in part to the change of the
Catholic French into our allies, and of the Protestant
English into our most active foes. It
must be remembered, however, that the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
gentry of Maryland played the same part in
the Revolution that their Protestant neighbors
did. One of the famous Carroll family was
among the signers of the Declaration of Independence;
and on the other hand, one of the
Cliftons was a noted loyalist leader.</p>

<p>Morris took a prominent part, both in and
out of committee, in trying to shape the plan
of reconciliation, although utterly disapproving
of many of the ways in which the subject
was handled; for he had all the contempt
natural to most young men of brains, decision,
and fiery temper, for his timid, short-sighted,
and prolix colleagues. The report was not all
to his taste in the final shape in which it was
adopted. It consisted of a series of articles
recommending the repeal of the obnoxious
statutes of the Imperial Parliament, the regulation
of trade for the benefit of the whole
empire, the establishment of triennial colonial
legislatures, and also asserting the right of the
colonies to manage their internal polity to
suit themselves, and their willingness to do
their part, according to their capacities, for the
general defense of the empire. The eighth article
contained a denial of the right of "Great
Britain, or any other earthly legislature or
tribunal, to interfere in the ecclesiastical or
religious concerns of the colonies," together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
with a "protest against the indulgence and establishment
of popery all along their interior
confines;" this being called forth by what was
known as the "Quebec Bill," whereby the
British Parliament had recently granted extraordinary
powers and privileges to the Canadian
clergy, with the obvious purpose of conciliating
that powerful priesthood, and thereby converting&mdash;as
was actually done&mdash;the recently conquered
French of the St. Lawrence valley into
efficient allies of the British government against
the old Protestant colonies.</p>

<p>This eighth article was ridiculous, and was
especially objected to by Morris. In one of his
vigorous, deliciously fresh, and humorous letters,
dated June 30, 1775, and addressed to John
Jay, then in the Continental Congress, he
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The foolish religious business I opposed until I was
weary; it was carried by a very small majority, and
my dissent entered.... The article about religion
is most arrant nonsense, and would do as well in a
high Dutch Bible as the place it now stands in.</p>

<p>I drew a long report for our committee, to which
they could make no objections excepting that none of
them could understand it.... I was pleased at the
rejection, because, as I observed to you before, I think
the question ought to be simplified.</p>

<p>I address this letter to you, but I shall be glad [if]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
you will read it to Livingstone, for I intend it for
both of you; make my compliments to him, and tell
him that I shall write to him when I have time to
write a good letter&mdash;this is a damned bad one, and
would not exist, if I did not think it a duty to myself
to show my friends that I had no hand in that
foolish religious business, I am, as you well know,
your friend, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Morris did not believe in a colonial assembly
making overtures for a reconciliation, as he
thought this was the province of the Continental
Congress. The majority was against him,
but he was a clever politician and parliamentary
tactician, as well as a great statesman, and
he fairly outwitted and hoodwinked his opponents,
persuading them finally to adopt the report
in the form of a mere expression of opinions
to be sent to their congressional delegates, with
a prayer that the latter would "use every effort
for the compromising of this unnatural quarrel
between the parent and child." In this shape it
was forwarded to the delegates, who answered
that they would do all in their power to compromise
the quarrel, and added a postscript,
written by Jay himself, to the effect that they
deemed it better not to make any mention of
the religious article before the Congress, as
they thought it wise to bury "all disputes on
ecclesiastical points, which have for ages had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
no other tendency than that of banishing peace
and charity from the world."</p>

<p>While all this was pending, and though
Bunker Hill had been fought, and the war was
in full progress round Boston, New York yet
maintained what might almost be described as
an attitude of armed neutrality. The city was
so exposed to the British war-ships in the bay,
and the surrounding population was so doubtful,
that the patriot party dared not take the
deciding steps, especially as so many of its
members still clung to the hope of a peaceful
settlement. Morris announced frankly that he
did not believe in breaking the peace until they
were prepared to take the consequences. Indeed,
when the few British troops left the city to
join the garrison in Boston, he strongly opposed
the action of the Sons of Liberty, who gathered
hastily together, and took away the cartloads
of arms and ammunition that the soldiers were
taking with them. The Congress, to their
honor, discouraged, to the best of their power,
the rioting and mobbing of Tories in the city.</p>

<p>In fact, New York's position was somewhat
like that of Kentucky at the outbreak of the
Civil War. Her backwardness in definitely
throwing in her lot with the revolutionists
was clearly brought out by a rather ludicrous
incident. General Washington, on his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to take command of the continental army
round Boston, passed through New York the
same day the royal governor, Tryon, arrived
by sea, and the authorities were cast into a
great quandary as to how they should treat two
such kings of Brentford when the one rose was
so small. Finally they compromised by sending
a guard of honor to attend each; Montgomery
and Morris, as delegates from the
Assembly, received Washington and brought
him before that body, which addressed him in
terms of cordial congratulation, but ended with
a noteworthy phrase,&mdash;that "when the contest
should be decided by an accommodation
with the mother country, he should deliver up
the important deposit that had been confided
to his hands."</p>

<p>These words give us the key to the situation.
Even the patriots of the colony could not realize
that there was no hope of an "accommodation";
and they were hampered at every
step by the fear of the British frigates, and of
the numerous Tories. The latter were very bold
and defiant; when Congress tried to disarm
them, they banded themselves together, bade
the authorities defiance, and plainly held the
upper land on Staten Island and in Queens
County. New York furnished many excellent
soldiers to the royal armies during the war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
from among her gentry came the most famous
of the Tory leaders,&mdash;such as Johnson and
De Lancey, whose prowess was felt by the hapless
people of their own native province; De
Peyster, who was Ferguson's second in command
at King's Mountain; and Cruger, who, in the
Carolinas, inflicted a check upon Greene himself.
The Tories were helped also by the jealousy
felt towards some of the other colonies,
especially Connecticut, whose people took the
worst possible course for the patriot side by
threatening to "crush down" New York, and
by finally furnishing an armed and mounted
mob which rode suddenly into the city, and
wrecked the office of an obnoxious loyalist
printer named Rivington. This last proceeding
caused great indignation, and nearly made
a split in the revolutionary camp.</p>

<p>New York had thus some cause for her inaction;
nevertheless, her lack of boldness and
decision were not creditable to her, and she laid
herself open to just reproaches. Nor can
Morris himself be altogether freed from the
charge of having clung too long to the hope
of a reconciliation and to a policy of half
measures. He was at that time chairman of
a legislative committee which denounced any
projected invasion of Canada (therein, however,
only following the example of the Continental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Congress), and refused to allow Ethan
Allen to undertake one, as that adventurous
partisan chieftain requested. But Morris was
too clear-sighted to occupy a doubtful position
long; and he now began to see things clearly
as they were, and to push his slower or more
timid associates forward along the path which
they had set out to tread. He was instrumental
in getting the militia into somewhat better
shape; and, as it was found impossible to get
enough continental money, a colonial paper
currency was issued. In spite of the quarrel
with Connecticut, a force from that province
moved in to take part in the defense of New
York.</p>

<p>Yet, in the main, the policy of the New York
Congress still continued both weak and changeable,
and no improvement was effected when it
was dissolved and a second elected. To this
body the loyalist counties of Richmond and
Queens refused to return delegates, and throughout
the colony affairs grew more disorderly, and
the administration of justice came nearly to a
standstill. Finding that the local congress
seemed likely to remain unable to make up
its mind how to act, the continental leaders at
last took matters into their own hands, and
marched a force into New York city early in
February, 1776. This had a most bracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
effect upon the provincial authorities; yet they
still continued to allow the British war-ships in
the bay to be supplied with provisions, nor was
this attitude altered until in April Washington
arrived with the main continental army. He
at once insisted that a final break should be
made; and about the same time the third Provincial
Congress was elected. Morris, again
returned for Westchester, headed the bolder
spirits, who had now decided that the time had
come to force their associates out of their wavering
course, and to make them definitely cast
in their lot with their fellow Americans. Things
had come to a point which made a decision
necessary; the gathering of the continental
forces on Manhattan Island and the threatening
attitude of the British fleet and army made
it impossible for even the most timid to keep
on lingering in a state of uncertainty. So the
Declaration of Independence was ratified, and
a state constitution organized; then the die was
cast, and thereafter New York manfully stood
by the result of the throw.</p>

<p>The two Provincial Congresses that decided
on this course held their sessions in a time of
the greatest tumult, when New York was
threatened hourly by the British; and long
before their work was ended they had hastily to
leave the city. Before describing what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
did, a glance should be taken at the circumstances
under which it was done.</p>

<p>The peaceable citizens, especially those with
any property, gradually left New York; and
it remained in possession of the raw levies of
the continentals, while Staten Island received
Howe with open arms, and he was enabled
without difficulty to disembark his great force
of British and German mercenaries on Long
Island. The much smaller, motley force opposed
to him, unorganized, ill armed, and led
by utterly inexperienced men, was beaten, with
hardly an effort, in the battle that followed, and
only escaped annihilation through the skill of
Washington and the supine blundering of
Howe. Then it was whipped up the Hudson
and beyond the borders of the State, the broken
remnant fleeing across New Jersey; and though
the brilliant feats of arms at Trenton and
Princeton enabled the Americans to reconquer
the latter province, southern New York lay
under the heel of the British till the close of
the war.</p>

<p>Thus Morris, Jay, and the other New York
leaders were obliged for six years to hold up
their cause in a half-conquered State, a very
large proportion of whose population was lukewarm
or hostile. The odds were heavy against
the patriots, because their worst foes were those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of their own household. English writers are
fond of insisting upon the alleged fact that
America only won her freedom by the help of
foreign nations. Such help was certainly most
important, but, on the other hand, it must be
remembered that during the first and vital years
of the contest the revolutionary colonists had to
struggle unaided against the British, their mercenary
German and Indian allies, Tories, and even
French Canadians. When the French court
declared in our favor the worst was already
over; Trenton had been won, Burgoyne had
been captured, and Valley Forge was a memory
of the past.</p>

<p>We did not owe our main disasters to the
might of our foes, nor our final triumph to
the help of our friends. It was on our own
strength that we had to rely, and it was with
our own folly and weakness that we had to
contend. The revolutionary leaders can never
be too highly praised; but taken in bulk the
Americans of the last quarter of the eighteenth
century do not compare to advantage with the
Americans of the third quarter of the nineteenth.
In our Civil War it was the people who pressed
on the leaders, and won almost as much in spite
of as because of them; but the leaders of the
Revolution had to goad the rank and file into
line. They were forced to contend not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
with the active hostility of the Tories, but with
the passive neutrality of the indifferent, and
the selfishness, jealousy, and short-sightedness
of the patriotic. Had the Americans of 1776
been united, and had they possessed the stubborn,
unyielding tenacity and high devotion to
an ideal shown by the North, or the heroic constancy
and matchless valor shown by the South,
in the Civil War, the British would have been
driven off the continent before three years
were over.</p>

<p>It is probable that nearly as great a proportion
of our own people were actively or passively
opposed to the formation of our union
originally as were in favor of its dissolution in
1860. This was one of the main reasons why
the war dragged on so long. It may be seen
by the fact, among others, that when in the
Carolinas and Georgia a system of relentless
and undying partisan warfare not only crushed
the Tories, but literally destroyed them from off
the face of the earth, then the British, though
still victorious in almost every pitched battle,
were at once forced to abandon the field.</p>

<p>Another reason was the inferior military
capacity of the revolutionary armies. The continental
troops, when trained, were excellent;
but in almost every battle they were mixed
with more or less worthless militia; and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
soldiers thus obtained all that can be said is
that their officers could never be sure that
they would fight, nor their enemies that they
would run away. The revolutionary troops
certainly fell short of the standard reached
by the volunteers who fought Shiloh and Gettysburg.
The British rarely found them to be
such foes as they afterwards met at New Orleans
and Lundy's Lane. Throughout the
Revolution the militia were invariably leaving
their posts at critical times; they would grow
either homesick or dejected, and would then
go home at the very crisis of the campaign;
they did not begin to show the stubbornness
and resolution to "see the war through" so
common among their descendants in the contending
Federal and Confederate armies.</p>

<p>The truth is that in 1776 our main task was
to shape new political conditions, and then to
reconcile our people to them; whereas in 1860
we had merely to fight fiercely for the preservation
of what was already ours. In the first
emergency we needed statesmen, and in the
second warriors; and the statesmen and warriors
were forthcoming. A comparison of the men
who came to the front during these, the two
heroic periods of the Republic, brings out this
point clearly.</p>

<p>Washington, alike statesman, soldier, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
patriot, stands alone. He was not only the
greatest American; he was also one of the
greatest men the world has ever known. Few
centuries and few countries have ever seen his
like. Among the people of English stock there
is none to compare with him, unless perhaps
Cromwell, utterly different though the latter
was. Of Americans, Lincoln alone is worthy
to stand even second.</p>

<p>As for our other statesmen: Franklin, Hamilton,
Jefferson, Adams, and their fellows, most
surely stand far above Seward, Sumner, Chase,
Stanton, and Stevens, great as were the services
which these, and those like them, rendered.</p>

<p>But when we come to the fighting men, all this
is reversed. As a mere military man Washington
himself cannot rank with the wonderful
war-chief who for four years led the Army of
Northern Virginia; and the names of Washington
and Greene fill up the short list of
really good Revolutionary Generals. Against
these the Civil War shows a roll that contains
not only Lee, but also Grant and Sherman,
Jackson and Johnson, Thomas, Sheridan, and
Farragut,&mdash;leaders whose volunteer soldiers
and sailors, at the end of their four years' service,
were ready and more than able to match
themselves against the best regular forces of
Europe.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>INDEPENDENCE: FORMING THE STATE
CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p>The third Provincial Congress, which came
together in May, and before the close of its
sessions was obliged to adjourn to White Plains,
had to act on the Declaration of Independence,
and provide for the foundation of a new state
government.</p>

<p>Morris now put himself at the head of the
patriotic party, and opened the proceedings by
a long and very able speech in favor of adopting
the recommendation of the Continental
Congress that the colonies should form new
governments. In his argument he went at
length into the history and growth of the dispute
with Great Britain, spoke of the efforts
made in the past for reconciliation, and then
showed clearly how such efforts were now not
only hopeless, but also no longer compatible
with the dignity and manhood of Americans.
He sneered at those who argued that we ought
to submit to Great Britain for the sake of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
protection we got from her. "Great Britain
will not fail to bring us into a war with some
of her neighbors, and then protect us as a
lawyer defends a suit: the client paying for it.
This is quite in form, but a wise man would, I
think, get rid of the suit and the lawyer together.
Again, how are we to be protected?
If a descent is made upon our coasts and the
British navy and army are three thousand miles
off, we cannot receive very great benefit from
them on that occasion. If, to obviate this
inconvenience, we have an army and navy constantly
among us, who can say that we shall
not need a little protection against <i>them</i>?" He
went on to point out the hopelessness of expecting
Great Britain to keep to any terms which
would deprive Parliament of its supremacy over
America: for no succeeding Parliament could
be held bound by the legislation of its predecessor,
and the very acknowledgment of British
supremacy on the part of the Americans would
bind them as subjects, and make the supremacy
of Parliament legitimate. He bade his hearers
remember the maxim "that no faith is to be
kept with rebels;" and said: "In this case, or
in any other case, if we fancy ourselves hardly
dealt with, I maintain there is no redress but
by arms. For it never yet was known that,
when men assume power, they will part with it
again, unless by compulsion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
He then took up the subject of independence,
showed, for the benefit of the good but timid
men who were frightened at the mere title,
that, in all but name, it already existed in New
York, and proved that its maintenance was
essential to our well-being. "My argument,
therefore, stands thus: As a connection with
Great Britain cannot again exist without enslaving
America, an independence is absolutely
necessary. I cannot balance between the two.
We run a hazard in one path, I confess; but
then we are infallibly ruined if we pursue the
other.... We find the characteristic marks
and insignia of independence in this society,
considered in itself and compared with other
societies. The enumeration is conviction. Coining
moneys, raising armies, regulating commerce,
peace, war: all these things you are not
only adepts in, but masters of. Treaties alone
remain, and even those you have dabbled at.
Georgia you put under the ban of empire, and
received her upon repentance as a member of
the flock. Canada you are now treating with.
France and Spain you ought to treat with, and
the rest is but a name. I believe, sir, the Romans
were as much governed, or rather oppressed,
by their emperors, as ever any people
were by their king. But emperor was more
agreeable to their ears than king. [So] some,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
nay, many, persons in America dislike the word
independence."</p>

<p>He then went on to show how independence
would work well alike for our peace, liberty, and
security. Considering the first, he laughed at
the apprehensions expressed by some that the
moment America was independent all the powers
of Europe would pounce down on her, to parcel
out the country among themselves; and showed
clearly that to a European power any war of
conquest in America would be "tedious, expensive,
uncertain, and ruinous," and that none
of the country could be kept even if it should
come to pass that some little portion of it were
conquered. "But I cannot think it will ever
come to this. For when I turn my eyes to the
means of defense, I find them amply sufficient.
We have all heard that in the last war America
was conquered in Germany. I hold the converse
of this to be true, namely, that in and
by America his Majesty's German dominions
were secured.... I expect a full and lasting
defense against any and every part of the
earth." After thus treating of the advantages
to be hoped for on the score of peace, he turns
attention "to a question of infinitely greater importance,
namely, the liberty of this country;"
and afterwards passes to the matter of security,
which, "so long as the system of laws by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
we are now governed shall prevail, is amply provided
for in every separate colony. There may
indeed arise an objection because some gentlemen
suppose that the different colonies will
carry on a sort of land piracy against one another.
But how this can possibly happen when
the idea of separate colonies no longer exists I
cannot for my soul comprehend. That something
very like this has already been done I
shall not deny, but the reason is as evident as
the fact. We never yet had a government in
this country of sufficient energy to restrain the
lawless and indigent. Whenever a form of
government is established which deserves the
name, these insurrections must cease. But who
is the man so hardy as to affirm that they will
not grow with our growth, while on every occasion
we must resort to an English judicature
to terminate differences which the maxims of
policy will teach them to leave undetermined?
By degrees we are getting beyond the utmost
pale of English government. Settlements are
forming to the westward of us, whose inhabitants
acknowledge no authority but their own."
In one sentence he showed rather a change of
heart, as regarded his former aristocratic leanings;
for he reproached those who were "apprehensive
of losing a little consequence and
importance by living in a country where all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
are on an equal footing," and predicted that we
should "cause all nations to resort hither as an
asylum from oppression."</p>

<p>The speech was remarkable for its incisive
directness and boldness, for the exact clearness
with which it portrayed things as they were,
for the broad sense of American nationality
that it displayed, and for the accurate forecasts
that it contained as to our future course in certain
particulars,&mdash;such as freedom from European
wars and entanglements, a strong but
purely defensive foreign policy, the encouragement
of the growth of the West, while keeping
it united to us, and the throwing open our doors
to the oppressed from abroad.</p>

<p>Soon after the delivery of this speech news
came that the Declaration of Independence had
been adopted by the Continental Congress; and
Jay, one of the New York delegates to this
body, and also a member of the Provincial
Congress, drew up for the latter a resolution
emphatically indorsing the declaration, which
was at once adopted without a dissenting voice.
At the same time the Provincial Congress
changed its name to that of "The Convention of
the Representatives of the State of New York."</p>

<p>These last acts were done by a body that had
been elected, with increased power, to succeed
the third Provincial Congress and provide for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
a new constitution. Just before this, Morris had
been sent to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia
to complain that the troops from New
England were paid more largely than those
from the other colonies; a wrong which was at
once redressed, the wages of the latter being
raised, and Morris returned to New York in
triumph after only a week's absence.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Convention of New York
led a most checkered life; for the victorious
British chevied it up and down the State, hunting
it in turn from every small town in which
it thought to have found a peaceful haven of
refuge. At last it rested in Fiskhill, such an
out-of-the-way place as to be free from danger.
The members were obliged to go armed, so as
to protect themselves from stray marauding
parties; and the number of delegates in attendance
alternately dwindled and swelled in
a wonderful manner, now resolving themselves
into a committee of safety, and again resuming
their functions as members of the convention.</p>

<p>The most important duties of the convention
were intrusted to two committees. Of the first,
which was to draft a plan for the Constitution,
Morris, Jay, and Livingston were the three
leading members, upon whom all the work fell;
of the second, which was to devise means for the
establishment of a state fund, Morris was the
chairman and moving spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
He was also chairman of a committee which
was appointed to look after the Tories, and prevent
them from joining together and rising;
and so numerous were they that the jails were
soon choked with those of their number who,
on account of their prominence or bitterness,
were most obnoxious to the patriots. Also a
partial system of confiscation of Tory estates
was begun. So greatly were the Tories feared
and hated, and so determined were the attempts
to deprive them of even the shadow of
a chance to do harm, by so much as a word, that
the convention sent a memorial, drafted by
Morris, to the Continental Congress, in which
they made the very futile suggestion that it
should take "some measures for expunging
from the Book of Common Prayer such parts,
and discontinuing in the congregations of all
other denominations all such prayers, as interfere
with the interests of the American cause."
The resolution was not acted on; but another
part of the memorial shows how the Church
of England men were standing by the mother
country, for it goes on to recite that "the
enemies of America have taken great pains to
insinuate into the minds of the Episcopalians
that the church is in danger. We could wish
the Congress would pass some resolve to quiet
their fears, and we are confident that it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
do essential service to the cause of America, at
least in this State."</p>

<p>Morris's position in regard to the Tories was
a peculiarly hard one, because among their
number were many of his own relatives, including
his elder brother. The family house,
where his mother resided, was within the
British lines; and not only did he feel the disapproval
of such of his people as were loyalists,
on the one side, but, on the other, his letters
to his family caused him to be regarded with
suspicion by the baser spirits in the American
party. About this time one of his sisters died;
the letter he then wrote to his mother is in the
usual formal style of the time, yet it shows marks
of deep feeling, and he takes occasion, while
admitting that the result of the war was uncertain,
to avow, with a sternness unusual to
him, his intention to face all things rather than
abandon the patriot cause. "The worst that
can happen is to fall on the last bleak mountain
of America; and he who dies there in
defense of the injured rights of mankind is
happier than his conqueror, more beloved by
mankind, more applauded by his own heart."
The letter closes by a characteristic touch, when
he sends his love to "such as deserve it. The
number is not great."</p>

<p>The committee on the constitution was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
ready to report until March, 1777. Then the
convention devoted itself solely to the consideration
of the report, which, after several weeks'
discussion, was adopted with very little change.
Jay and Morris led the debate before the
convention, as they had done previously in
committee. There was perfect agreement upon
the general principles. Freehold suffrage was
adopted, and a majority of the freeholders of the
State were thus the ultimate governing power.
The executive, judicial, and legislative powers
were separated sharply, as was done in the
other States, and later on in the Federal Constitution
as well. The legislative body was
divided into two chambers.</p>

<p>It was over the executive branch that the
main contest arose. It was conceded that this
should be nominally single headed; that is,
that there should be a governor. But the
members generally could not realize how different
was a governor elected by the people
and responsible to them, from one appointed by
an alien and higher power to rule over them, as
in the colonial days. The remembrance of the
contests with the royal governors was still fresh;
and the mere name of governor frightened
them. They had the same illogical fear of the
executive that the demagogues of to-day (and
some honest but stupid people, as well) profess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to feel for a standing army. Men often let
the dread of the shadow of a dead wrong
frighten them into courting a living evil.</p>

<p>Morris himself was wonderfully clear-sighted
and cool-headed. He did not let the memory
of the wrong-doing of the royal governors
blind him; he saw that the trouble with them
lay, not in the power that they held, but in the
source from which that power came. Once the
source was changed, the power was an advantage,
not a harm, to the State. Yet few or none
of his companions could see this; and they
nervously strove to save their new State from
the danger of executive usurpation by trying
to make the executive practically a board of
men instead of one man, and by crippling it so
as to make it ineffective for good, while at the
same time dividing the responsibility, so that
no one need be afraid to do evil. Above all,
they were anxious to take away from the governor
the appointment of the military and civil
servants of the State.</p>

<p>Morris had persuaded the committee to leave
the appointment of these officials to the governor,
the legislature retaining the power of
confirmation or rejection; but the convention,
under the lead of Jay, rejected this proposition,
and after some discussion adopted in its
place the cumbrous and foolish plan of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
"council of appointment," to consist of the
governor and several senators. As might have
been expected, this artificial body worked nothing
but harm, and became simply a peculiarly
odious political machine.</p>

<p>Again, Morris advocated giving the governor
a qualified veto over the acts passed by the
legislature; but instead of such a simple and
straightforward method of legislative revision,
the convention saw fit to adopt a companion
piece of foolishness to the council of appointment,
in the shape of the equally complicated
and anomalous council of revision, consisting of
the governor, chancellor, and judges of the supreme
court, by whom all the acts of the legislature
had to be revised before they could
become laws. It is marvelous that these two
bodies should have lived on so long as they did&mdash;over
forty years.</p>

<p>The convention did one most praiseworthy
thing in deciding in favor of complete religious
toleration. This seems natural enough now;
but at that time there was hardly a European
state that practiced it. Great Britain harassed
her Catholic subjects in a hundred different
ways, while in France Protestants were treated
far worse, and, in fact, could scarcely be regarded
as having any legal standing whatever.
On no other one point do the statesmen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Revolution show to more marked advantage
when compared with their European compeers
than in this of complete religious toleration.
Their position was taken, too, simply because
they deemed it to be the right and proper one;
they had nothing to fear or hope from Catholics,
and their own interests were in no wise advanced
by what they did in the matter.</p>

<p>But in the New York convention toleration
was not obtained without a fight. There always
rankled in Jay's mind the memory of the
terrible cruelty wrought by Catholics on his
Huguenot forefathers; and he introduced into
the article on toleration an appendix, which discriminated
against the adherents of the Church
of Rome, denying them the rights of citizenship
until they should solemnly swear before
the supreme court, first, "that they verily believe
in their conscience, that no pope, priest, or
foreign authority on earth has power to absolve
the subjects of this State from their allegiance
to the same;" and, second, "that they renounce ... the
dangerous and damnable doctrine that
the Pope or any other earthly authority has
power to absolve men from sins described in
and prohibited by the Holy Gospel." This
second point, however important, was of purely
theological interest, and had absolutely nothing
to do with the state constitution; as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
first proposition, it might have been proper
enough had there been the least chance of a
conflict between the Pope, either in his temporal
or his ecclesiastical capacity, and the United
States; but as there was no possibility of such
a conflict arising, and as, if it did arise, there
would not be the slightest danger of the United
States receiving any damage, to put the sentence
in would have been not only useless, but
exceedingly foolish and harmful, on account of
the intense irritation it would have excited.</p>

<p>The whole clause was rejected by a two to
one vote, and then all the good that it aimed
at was accomplished by the adoption, on the
motion of Morris, of a proviso that the toleration
granted should not be held to "justify
practices inconsistent with the peace and safety
of this State." This proviso of Morris remains
in the Constitution to this day; and thus,
while absolute religious liberty is guaranteed,
the State reserves to itself full right of protection,
if necessary, against the adherents of any
religious body, foreign or domestic, if they
menace the public safety.</p>

<p>On a question even more important than
religious toleration, namely, the abolition of
domestic slavery, Jay and Morris fought side
by side; but though the more enlightened of
their fellow-members went with them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
were a little too much in advance of the age,
and failed. They made every effort to have a
clause introduced into the constitution recommending
to the future legislature of New York
to abolish slavery as soon as it could be done
consistently with the public safety and the
rights of property; "so that in future ages every
human being who breathes the air of this State
shall enjoy the privileges of a free man." Although
they failed in their immediate purpose,
yet they had much hearty support, and by the
bold stand they took and the high ground they
occupied they undoubtedly brought nearer the
period when the abolition of slavery in New
York became practicable.</p>

<p>The Constitution was finally adopted by the
convention almost unanimously, and went into
effect forthwith, as there was no ratification by
the people at large.</p>

<p>As soon as it was adopted a committee, which
included Morris, Jay, and Livingston, was appointed
to start and organize the new government.
The courts of justice were speedily put
in running order, and thus one of the most crying
evils that affected the State was remedied.
A council of safety of fifteen members&mdash;again
including Morris&mdash;was established to act as
the provincial government, until the regular
legislature should convene. An election for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
governor was also held almost immediately,
and Clinton was chosen. He was then serving
in the field, where he had done good work, and,
together with his brother James, had fought
with the stubborn valor that seems to go with
Anglo-Irish blood. He did not give up his
command until several months after he was
elected, although meanwhile keeping up constant
communication with the council of safety,
through whom he acted in matters of state.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Burgoyne, with his eight or nine
thousand troops, excellently drilled British
and Hessians, assisted by Tories, Canadians,
and Indians, had crossed the northern frontier,
and was moving down towards the heart of
the already disorganized State, exciting the
wildest panic and confusion. The council of
safety hardly knew how to act, and finally sent
a committee of two, Morris being one, to the
headquarters of General Schuyler, who had the
supreme command over all the troops in the
northern part of New York.</p>

<p>On Morris's arrival he found affairs at a very
low ebb, and at once wrote to describe this condition
to the president of the council of safety.
Burgoyne's army had come steadily on. He
first destroyed Arnold's flotilla on Lake Champlain.
Then he captured the forts along the
Lakes, and utterly wrecked the division of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
American army that had been told off to defend
them, under the very unfortunate General St.
Clair. He was now advancing through the great
reaches of wooded wilderness towards the head
of the Hudson. Schuyler, a general of fair
capacity, was doing what he could to hold the
enemy back; but his one efficient supporter was
the wilderness itself, through which the British
army stumbled painfully along. Schuyler had
in all less than five thousand men, half of them
short service continental troops, the other half
militia. The farmers would not turn out until
after harvest home; all the bodies of militia,
especially those from New England, were very
insubordinate and of most fickle temper, and
could not be depended on for any sustained
contest; as an example, Stark, under whose
nominal command the northern New Engenders
won the battle of Bennington, actually
marched off his whole force the day before the
battle of Stillwater, alleging the expiration of
the term of service of his soldiers as an excuse for
what looked like gross treachery or cowardice,
but was probably merely sheer selfish wrong-headedness
and mean jealousy. Along the Mohawk
valley the dismay was extreme, and the
militia could not be got out at all. Jay was so
angered by the abject terror in this quarter that
he advised leaving the inhabitants to shift for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
themselves; sound advice, too, for when the
pinch came and they were absolutely forced
to take arms, they did very fairly at Oriskany.
It was even feared that the settlers of the region
which afterwards became Vermont would
go over to the enemy; still, time and space were
in our favor, and Morris was quite right when
he said in his first letter (dated July 16, 1777):
"Upon the whole I think we shall do very
well, but this opinion is founded merely upon
the barriers which nature has raised against
all access from the northward." As he said of
himself, he was "a good guesser."</p>

<p>He outlined the plan which he thought the
Americans should follow. This was to harass
the British in every way, without risking a
stand-up fight, while laying waste the country
through which they were to pass so as to render
it impossible for an army to subsist on it. For
the militia he had the most hearty contempt,
writing: "Three hundred of the militia of
Massachusetts Bay went off this morning, in
spite of the opposition&mdash;we should have said, entreaties&mdash;of
their officers. All the militia on the
ground are so heartily tired, and so extremely
desirous of getting home, that it is more than
probable that none of them will remain here
ten days longer. One half was discharged two
days ago, to silence, if possible, their clamor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and the remainder, officers excepted, will soon
discharge themselves."</p>

<p>The council of safety grew so nervous over the
outlook that their letters became fairly querulous;
and they not unnaturally asked Morris to
include in his letters some paragraphs that could
be given to the public. To this that rather
quick-tempered gentleman took exceptions, and
replied caustically in his next letter, the opening
paragraph being: "We have received yours
of the 19th, which has afforded us great pleasure,
since we are enabled in some measure to
collect from it our errand to the northward,
one of the most important objects of our journey
being, in the opinion of your honorable body,
to write the news," and he closes by stating
that he shall come back to wait upon them, and
learn their pleasure, at once.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the repeated disasters in the north
had occasioned much clamor against Schuyler,
who, if not a brilliant general, had still done
what he could in very trying circumstances,
and was in no wise responsible for the various
mishaps that had occurred. The New England
members of Congress, always jealous of New
York, took advantage of this to begin intriguing
against him, under the lead of Roger
Sherman and others, and finally brought about
his replacement by Gates, a much inferior man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
with no capacity whatever for command. Morris
and Jay both took up Schuyler's cause very
warmly, seeing clearly, in the first place, that
the disasters were far from ruinous, and that a
favorable outcome was probable; and, in the
second place, that it was the people themselves
who were to blame and not Schuyler. They
went on to Philadelphia to speak for him, but
they arrived just a day too late, Gates having
been appointed twenty-four hours previous to
their coming.</p>

<p>When Gates reached his army the luck had
already begun to turn. Burgoyne's outlying
parties had been destroyed, his Indians and
Canadians had left him, he had been disappointed
in his hopes of a Tory uprising in his
favor, and, hampered by his baggage-train, he
had been brought almost to a stand-still in the
tangled wilds through which he had slowly
ploughed his way. Schuyler had done what he
could to hinder the foe's progress, and had kept
his own army together as a rallying point for
the militia, who, having gathered in their harvests,
and being inspirited by the outcome of the
fights at Oriskany and Bennington, flocked in
by hundreds to the American standard. Gates
himself did literally nothing; he rather hindered
his men than otherwise; and the latter
were turbulent and prone to disobey orders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
But they were now in fine feather for fighting,
and there were plenty of them. So Gates
merely sat still, and the levy of backwoods
farmers, all good individual fighters, and with
some excellent brigade and regimental commanders,
such as Arnold and Morgan, fairly
mobbed to death the smaller number of dispirited
and poorly led regulars against whom they were
pitted. When the latter were at last fought
out and forced to give in, Gates allowed them
much better terms than he should have done;
and the Continental Congress, to its shame,
snatched at a technicality, under cover of which
to break the faith plighted through its general,
and to avoid fulfilling the conditions to which
he had so foolishly agreed.</p>

<p>Morris and Jay, though unable to secure the
retention of Schuyler, had, nevertheless, by their
representations while at Philadelphia, prevailed
on the authorities largely to reinforce the army
which was about to be put under Gates. Morris
was very angry at the intrigue by which the
latter had been given the command; but what
he was especially aiming at was the success of
the cause, not the advancement of his friends.
Once Gates was appointed he did all in his
power to strengthen him, and, with his usual
clear-sightedness, he predicted his ultimate success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Schuyler was a man of high character and
public spirit, and he behaved really nobly in
the midst of his disappointment; his conduct
throughout affording a very striking contrast to
that of McClellan, under somewhat similar circumstances
in the Civil War. Morris wrote him,
sympathizing with him, and asking him to sink
all personal feeling and devote his energies to
the common weal of the country while out of
power just as strenuously as he had done when
in command. Schuyler responded that he
should continue to serve his country as zealously
as before, and he made his words good;
but Gates was jealous of the better man whose
downfall he had been the instrument of accomplishing,
and declined to profit by his help.</p>

<p>In a later letter to Schuyler, written September
18, 1777, Morris praised the latter very
warmly for the way he had behaved, and commented
roughly on Gates' littleness of spirit.
He considered that with such a commander
there was nothing to be hoped for from skillful
management, and that Burgoyne would have to
be simply tired out. Alluding to a rumor that
the Indians were about to take up the hatchet
for us, he wrote, in the humorous vein he
adopted so often in dealing even with the most
pressing matters: "If this be true, it would be
infinitely better to wear away the enemy's army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
by a scrupulous and polite attention, than to
violate the rules of decorum and the laws of
hospitality by making an attack upon strangers
in our own country!" He gave Schuyler the
news of Washington's defeat at the battle of
Brandywine, and foretold the probable loss of
Philadelphia and a consequent winter campaign.</p>

<p>In ending he gave a thoroughly characteristic
sketch of the occupations of himself and his
colleagues. "The chief justice (Jay) is gone
to fetch his wife. The chancellor (Livingston)
is solacing himself with his wife, his farm, and
his imagination. Our senate is doing, I know
not what. In assembly we wrangle long to
little purpose.... We have some principles
of fermentation which must, if it be possible,
evaporate before business is entered upon."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>IN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>At the end of 1777, while still but twenty-five
years old, Morris was elected to the Continental
Congress, and took his seat in that
body at Yorktown in the following January.</p>

<p>He was immediately appointed as one of a
committee of five members to go to Washington's
headquarters at Valley Forge and examine
into the condition of the continental
troops.</p>

<p>The dreadful suffering of the American army
in this winter camp was such that its memory
has literally eaten its way into the hearts of
our people, and it comes before our minds with
a vividness that dims the remembrance of any
other disaster. Washington's gaunt, half-starved
continentals, shoeless and ragged, shivered
in their crazy huts, worn out by want
and illness, and by the bitter cold; while the
members of the Continental Congress not only
failed to support them in the present, but
even grudged them the poor gift of a promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of half-pay in the future. Some of the delegates,
headed by Samuel Adams, were actually
caballing against the great chief himself,
the one hope of America. Meanwhile the
States looked askance at each other, and each
sunk into supine indifference when its own
borders were for the moment left unthreatened
by the foe. Throughout the Revolutionary
War our people hardly once pulled with a will
together; although almost every locality in
turn, on some one occasion, varied its lethargy
by a spasm of terrible energy. Yet, again, it
must be remembered that we were never more
to be dreaded than when our last hope seemed
gone; and if the people were unwilling to
show the wisdom and self-sacrifice that would
have insured success, they were equally determined
under no circumstances whatever to acknowledge
final defeat.</p>

<p>To Jay, with whom he was always intimate,
Morris wrote in strong terms from Valley
Forge, painting things as they were, but without
a shadow of doubt or distrust; for he by
this time saw clearly enough that in American
warfare the darkest hour was often followed
close indeed by dawn. "The skeleton of an
army presents itself to our eyes in a naked,
starving condition, out of health, out of spirits.
But I have seen Fort George in 1777." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
last sentence refers to what he saw of Schuyler's
forces, when affairs in New York State
were at the blackest, just before the tide began
to turn against Burgoyne. He then went
on to beseech Jay to exert himself to the utmost
on the great question of taxation, the
most vital of all. Morris himself was so good a
financier that revolutionary financial economics
drove him almost wild. The Continental Congress,
of which he had just become a member,
he did not esteem very highly, and dismissed
it, as well as the currency, as having "both
depreciated." The State of Pennsylvania, he
remarked, was "sick unto death;" and added
that "Sir William [the British general] would
prove a most damnable physician."</p>

<p>Most wisely, in examining and reporting, he
paid heed almost exclusively to Washington's
recommendations, and the plan he and his
colleagues produced was little more than an
enlargement of the general's suggestions as
to filling out the regiments, regulating rank,
modeling the various departments, etc. In fact,
Morris now devoted himself to securing the approval
of Congress for Washington's various
plans.</p>

<p>In urging one of the most important of these
he encountered very determined opposition.
Washington was particularly desirous of securing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a permanent provision for the officers by
the establishment of a system of half-pay, stating
that without some such arrangement he
saw no hope whatever for the salvation of the
cause; for as things then were the officers were
leaving day by day; and of those who went
home on furlough to the Eastern and Southern
States, many, instead of returning, went into
some lucrative employment. This fact, by
the way, while showing the difficulties with
which Washington had to deal, and therefore
his greatness, since he successfully dealt with
them, at the same time puts the officers of the
Revolution in no very favorable light as compared
with their descendants at the time of
the great rebellion; and the Continental Congress
makes a still worse showing.</p>

<p>When Morris tried to push through a
measure providing for half-pay for life he was
fought, tooth and nail, by many of his colleagues,
including, to their lasting discredit be
it said, every delegate from New England.
The folly of these ultra-democratic delegates
almost passes belief. They seemed incapable
of learning how the fight for liberty should be
made. Their leaders, like Samuel Adams and
John Hancock, did admirable service in exciting
the Americans to make the struggle; but
once it was begun, their function ended, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
from thence onward they hampered almost as
much as they helped the patriot cause. New
England, too, had passed through the period
when its patriotic fervor was at white heat. It
still remained as resolute as ever; and if the
danger had been once more brought home to
its very door-sill, then it would have risen
again as it had risen before; but without the
spur of an immediate necessity it moved but
sluggishly.</p>

<p>The New Englanders were joined by the
South Carolina delegates. Morris was backed
by the members from New York, Virginia, and
the other States, and he won the victory, but
not without being obliged to accept amendments
that took away some of the good of the
measure. Half-pay was granted, but it was only
to last for seven years after the close of the
war; and the paltry bounty of eighty dollars
was to be given to every soldier who served out
his time to the end.</p>

<p>At the same period Morris was engaged on
numerous other committees, dealing chiefly
with the finances, or with the remedy of abuses
that had crept into the administration of the
army. In one of his reports he exposed
thoroughly the frightful waste in the purchase
and distribution of supplies, and, what was
much worse, the accompanying frauds. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
frauds had become a most serious evil; Jay, in
one of his letters to Morris, had already urgently
requested him to turn his attention especially
to stopping the officers, in particular
those of the staff, from themselves engaging in
trade, on account of the jobbing and swindling
that it produced. The shoddy contractors of
the Civil War had plenty of predecessors in the
Revolution.</p>

<p>When these events occurred, in the spring of
1778, it was already three years after the fight
at Lexington; certainly, the continental armies
of that time do not compare favorably, even
taking all difficulties into account, with the
Confederate forces which, in 1864, three years
after the fall of Sumter, fronted Grant and
Sherman. The men of the Revolution failed
to show the capacity to organize for fighting
purposes, and the ability to bend all energies
towards the attainment of a given end, which
their great-grandsons of the Civil War, both at
the North and the South, possessed. Yet, after
all, their very follies sprang from their virtues,
from their inborn love of freedom, and their
impatience of the control of outsiders. So
fierce had they been in their opposition to the
rule of foreigners that they were now hardly
willing to submit to being ruled by themselves;
they had seen power so abused that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
they feared its very use; they were anxious to
assert their independence of all mankind, even
of each other. Stubborn, honest, and fearless,
they were taught with difficulty, and only by
the grinding logic of an imperious necessity,
that it was no surrender of their freedom to
submit to rulers chosen by themselves, through
whom alone that freedom could be won. They
had not yet learned that right could be enforced
only by might, that union was to the
full as important as liberty, because it was the
prerequisite condition for the establishment
and preservation of liberty.</p>

<p>But if the Americans of the Revolution were
not perfect, how their faults dwindle when we
stand them side by side with their European
compeers! What European nation then brought
forth rulers as wise and pure as our statesmen,
or masses as free and self-respecting as our
people? There was far more swindling, jobbing,
cheating, and stealing in the English army than
in ours; the British king and his ministers
need no criticism; and the outcome of the war
proves that their nation as a whole was less
resolute than our own. As for the other European
powers, the faults of our leaders sink out
of sight when matched against the ferocious
frivolity of the French noblesse, or the ignoble,
sordid, bloody baseness of those swinish German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
kinglets who let out their subjects to do hired
murder, and battened on the blood and sweat
of the wretched beings under them, until the
whirlwind of the French Revolution swept
their carcasses from off the world they cumbered.</p>

<p>We must needs give all honor to the men
who founded our Commonwealth; only in so
doing let us remember that they brought into
being a government under which their children
were to grow better and not worse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Washington at once recognized in Morris a
man whom he could trust in every way, and
on whose help he could rely in other matters
besides getting his officers half-pay. The
young New Yorker was one of the great Virginian's
warmest supporters in Congress, and
took the lead in championing his cause at every
turn. He was the leader in putting down
intrigues like that of the French-Irish adventurer
Conway, his ready tongue and knowledge
of parliamentary tactics, no less than his
ability, rendering him the especial dread and
dislike of the anti-Washington faction.</p>

<p>Washington wrote to Morris very freely, and
in one of his letters complained of the conduct
of some of the officers who wished to resign
when affairs looked dark and to be reinstated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as soon as they brightened a little. Morris
replied with one of his bright caustic letters,
sparing his associates very little, their pompous
tediousness and hesitation being peculiarly
galling to a man so far-seeing and so prompt to
make up his mind. He wrote: "We are going
on with the regimental arrangements as fast as
possible, and I think the day begins to appear
with respect to that business. Had our Saviour
addressed a chapter to the rulers of mankind,
as he did many to the subjects, I am persuaded
his good sense would have dictated this text:
<i>Be not wise overmuch</i>. Had the several members
who compose our multifarious body been
only wise <i>enough</i>, our business would long since
have been completed. But our superior abilities,
or the desire of appearing to possess them,
lead us to such exquisite tediousness of debate
that the most precious moments pass unheeded
away.... As to what you mention of the
extraordinary demeanor of some gentlemen, I
cannot but agree with you that such conduct
is not the most <i>honorable</i>. But, on the other
hand, you must allow that it is the most <i>safe</i>
and certainly you are not to learn that, however
ignorant of that happy art in your own
person, the bulk of us bipeds know well how
to balance solid pudding against empty praise.
There are other things, my dear sir, beside
virtue, which are their own <i>reward</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Washington chose Morris as his confidential
friend and agent to bring privately before Congress
a matter in reference to which he did not
consider it politic to write publicly. He was
at that time annoyed beyond measure by the
shoals of foreign officers who were seeking employment
in the army, and he wished Congress
to stop giving them admission to the service.
These foreign officers were sometimes honorable
men, but more often adventurers; with two or
three striking exceptions they failed to do as
well as officers of native birth; and, as later in
the Civil War, so in the Revolution, it appeared
that Americans could be best commanded by
Americans. Washington had the greatest dislike
for these adventurers, stigmatizing them
as "men who in the first instance tell you that
they wish for nothing more than the honor of
serving in so glorious a cause as volunteers, the
next day solicit rank without pay, the day following
want money advanced to them, and in
the course of a week want further promotion,
and are not satisfied with anything you can
do for them." He ended by writing: "I do
most devoutly wish that we had not a single
foreigner among us, except the Marquis de
Lafayette, who acts upon very different principles
from those which govern the rest." To
Lafayette, indeed, America owes as much as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
any of her own children, for his devotion to us
was as disinterested and sincere as it was effective;
and it is a pleasant thing to remember
that we, in our turn, not only repaid him
materially, but, what he valued far more, that
our whole people yielded him all his life long
the most loving homage a man could receive.
No man ever kept pleasanter relations with a
people he had helped than Lafayette did with
us.</p>

<p>Morris replied to Washington that he would
do all in his power to aid him. Meanwhile he
had also contracted a very warm friendship for
Greene, then newly appointed quartermaster
general of the army, and proved a most useful
ally, both in and out of Congress, in helping
the general to get his department in good running
order, and in extricating it from the
frightful confusion in which it had previously
been plunged.</p>

<p>He also specially devoted himself at this time
to an investigation of the finances, which were
in a dreadful condition; and by the ability with
which he performed his very varied duties he
acquired such prominence that he was given
the chairmanship of the most important of all
the congressional committees. This was the
committee to which was confided the task of
conferring with the British commissioners, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
had been sent over, in the spring of 1778, to
treat with the Americans, in accordance with
the terms of what were known as Lord North's
conciliatory bills. These bills were two in
number, the first giving up the right of taxation,
about which the quarrel had originally
arisen, and the second authorizing the commissioners
to treat with the revolted colonies on all
questions in dispute. They were introduced in
Parliament on account of the little headway
made by the British in subduing their former
subjects, and were pressed hastily through because
of the fear of an American alliance with
France, which was then, indeed, almost concluded.</p>

<p>Three years before, these bills would have
achieved their end; but now they came by just
that much time too late. The embittered warfare
had lasted long enough entirely to destroy
the old friendly feelings; and the Americans
having once tasted the "perilous pleasure" of
freedom, having once stretched out their arms
and stood before the world's eyes as their own
masters, it was certain that they would never
forego their liberty, no matter with what
danger it was fraught, no matter how light the
yoke, or how kindly the bondage, by which it
was to be replaced.</p>

<p>Two days after the bills were received, Morris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
drew up and presented his report, which was
unanimously adopted by Congress. Its tenor
can be gathered from its summing up, which
declared that the indispensable preliminaries to
any treaty would have to be the withdrawal of
all the British fleets and armies, and the acknowledgment
of the independence of the
United States; and it closed by calling on the
several States to furnish without delay their
quotas of troops for the coming campaign.</p>

<p>This decisive stand was taken when America
was still without allies in the contest; but ten
days afterwards messengers came to Congress,
bearing copies of the treaty with France. It
was ratified forthwith, and again Morris was
appointed chairman of a committee, this time
to issue an address on the subject to the American
people at large. He penned this address
himself, explaining fully the character of the
crisis, and going briefly over the events that
had led to it; and shortly afterwards he drew
up, on behalf of Congress, a sketch of all the
proceedings in reference to the British commissioners,
under the title of "Observations on the
American Revolution," giving therein a masterly
outline not only of the doings of Congress
in the particular matter under consideration,
but also an account of the causes of the war,
of the efforts of the Americans to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
peace, and of the chief events that had taken
place, as well as a comparison between the contrasting
motives and aims of the contestants.</p>

<p>Morris was one of the committee appointed
to receive the French minister, M. Gerard.
Immediately afterwards he was also selected by
Congress to draft the instructions which were
to be sent to Franklin, the American minister
at the court of Versailles. As a token of the
closeness of our relations with France, he was
requested to show these instructions to M.
Gerard, which he accordingly did; and some
interesting features of the conversation between
the two men have been preserved for us in the
despatches of Gerard to the French court.
The Americans were always anxious to undertake
the conquest of Canada, although
Washington did not believe the scheme feasible;
and the French strongly, although secretly,
opposed it, as it was their policy from
the beginning that Canada should remain English.
Naturally the French did not wish to see
America transformed into a conquering power,
a menace to themselves and to the Spaniards
as well as to the English; nor can they be
criticised for feeling in this way, or taunted
with acting only from motives of self-interest.
It is doubtless true that their purposes in going
into the war were mixed; they unquestionably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
wished to benefit themselves, and to hurt
their old and successful rival; but it is equally
unquestionable that they were also moved by
a generous spirit of sympathy and admiration
for the struggling colonists. It would, however,
have been folly to let this sympathy blind
them to the consequences that might ensue to all
Europeans having possessions in America, if the
Americans should become not only independent,
but also aggressive; and it was too much to
expect them to be so far-sighted as to see that,
once independent, it was against the very nature
of things that the Americans should <i>not</i>
be aggressive, and impossible that they should
be aught but powerful and positive instruments,
both in their own persons and by their
example, in freeing the whole western continent
from European control.</p>

<p>Accordingly M. Gerard endeavored, though
without success, to prevail on Morris not to
mention the question of an invasion of Canada
in the instructions to Franklin. He also
warned the American of the danger of alarming
Spain by manifesting a wish to encroach
on its territory in the Mississippi valley, mentioning
and condemning the attitude taken by
several members of Congress to the effect that
the navigation of the Mississippi should belong
equally to the English and Americans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Morris's reply showed how little even the
most intelligent American of that time&mdash;especially
if he came from the Northern or
Eastern States&mdash;could appreciate the destiny
of his country. He stated that his colleagues
favored restricting the growth of our country
to the south and west, and believed that the
navigation of the Mississippi, from the Ohio
down, should belong exclusively to the Spaniards,
as otherwise the western settlements
springing up in the valley of the Ohio, and on
the shores of the Great Lakes, would not only
domineer over Spain, but also over the United
States, and would certainly render themselves
independent in the end. He further said that
some at least of those who were anxious to
secure the navigation of the Mississippi, were
so from interested motives, having money ventures
in the establishments along the river.
However, if he at this time failed fully to grasp
his country's future, he was later on one of the
first in the Northern States to recognize it;
and once he did see it he promptly changed,
and became the strongest advocate of our territorial
expansion.</p>

<p>Accompanying his instructions to Franklin,
Morris sent a pamphlet entitled "Observations
on the Finances of America," to be laid
before the French ministry. Practically, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that the pamphlet amounted to was a most
urgent begging letter, showing that our own
people could not, or would not, either pay
taxes, or take up a domestic loan, so that we
stood in dire need of a subsidy from abroad.
The drawing up of such a document could
hardly have been satisfactory employment for
a high spirited man who wished to be proud of
his country.</p>

<p>All through our negotiations with France
and England Morris's views coincided with
those of Washington, Hamilton, Jay, and the
others who afterwards became leaders of the
Federalist party. Their opinions were well
expressed by Jay in a letter to Morris written
about this time, which ran: "I view a return
to the domination of Britain with horror, and
would risk all for independence; but that point
ceded, ... the destruction of Old England
would hurt me; I wish it well; it afforded my
ancestors an asylum from persecution." The
rabid American adherents of France could not
understand such sentiments, and the more mean
spirited among them always tried to injure
Morris on account of his loyalist relatives, although
so many families were divided in this
same way, Franklin's only son being himself
a prominent Tory. So bitter was this feeling
that when, later on, Morris's mother, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
within the British lines, became very ill, he
actually had to give up his intended visit to
her, because of the furious clamor that was
raised against it. He refers bitterly, in one of
his letters to Jay, to the "malevolence of individuals,"
as something he had to expect, but
which he announced that he would conquer by
so living as to command the respect of those
whose respect was worth having.</p>

<p>When, however, his foes were of sufficient
importance to warrant his paying attention to
them individually, Morris proved abundantly
able to take care of himself, and to deal heavier
blows than he received. This was shown in
the controversy which convulsed Congress over
the conduct of Silas Deane, the original American
envoy to France. Deane did not behave
very well, but at first he was certainly much
more sinned against than sinning, and Morris
took up his cause warmly. Thomas Paine, the
famous author of "Common Sense," who was
secretary of the Committee of Foreign Affairs,
attacked Deane and his defenders, as well as
the court of France, with peculiar venom, using
as weapons the secrets he became acquainted
with through his official position, and which he
was in honor bound not to divulge. For this
Morris had him removed from his secretaryship,
and in the debate handled him extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
roughly, characterizing him with contemptuous
severity as "a mere adventurer from England ... ignorant
even of grammar," and ridiculing
his pretensions to importance. Paine was an
adept in the art of invective; but he came out
second best in this encounter, and never forgot
or forgave his antagonist.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, Morris was kept too
busily at work to spare time for altercations.
He was chairman of three important standing
committees, those on the commissary, quartermaster's,
and medical departments, and did the
whole business for each. He also had more
than his share of special committee work, besides
playing his full part in the debates and
consultations of the Congress itself. Moreover,
his salary was so small that he had to eke it
out by the occasional practice of his profession.
He devoted himself especially to the consideration
of our finances and of our foreign relations;
and, as he grew constantly to possess
more and more weight and influence in Congress,
he was appointed, early in 1779, as chairman
of a very important committee, which was
to receive communications from our ministers
abroad, as well as from the French envoy. He
drew out its report, together with the draft of
instructions to our foreign ministers, which it
recommended. Congress accepted the first, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
adopted the last, without change, whereby it
became the basis of the treaty by which we
finally won peace. In his draft he had been
careful not to bind down our representatives on
minor points, and to leave them as large liberty
of action as was possible; but the main
issues, such as the boundaries, the navigation
of the Mississippi, and the fisheries, were discussed
at length and in order.</p>

<p>At the time this draft of instructions for a
treaty was sent out there was much demand
among certain members in Congress that we
should do all in our power to make foreign
alliances, and to procure recognitions of our independence
in every possible quarter. To this
Morris was heartily opposed, deeming that this
"rage for treaties," as he called it, was not
very dignified on our part. He held rightly that
our true course was to go our own gait, without
seeking outside favor, until we had shown ourselves
able to keep our own place among nations,
when the recognitions would come without asking.
Whether European nations recognized us
as a free people, or not, was of little moment so
long as we ourselves knew that we had become
one in law and in fact, through the right of
battle and the final arbitrament of the sword.</p>

<p>Besides these questions of national policy,
Morris also had to deal with an irritating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
matter affecting mainly New York. This was
the dispute of that state with the people of Vermont,
who wished to form a separate commonwealth
of their own, while New York claimed
that their lands came within its borders. Even
the fear of their common foe, the British,
against whom they needed to employ their
utmost strength, was barely sufficient to prevent
the two communities from indulging in a
small civil war of their own; and they persisted
in pressing their rival claims upon the attention
of Congress, and clamoring for a decision from
that harassed and overburdened body. Clinton,
who was much more of a politician than a statesman,
led the popular party in this foolish business,
the majority of the New Yorkers being
apparently nearly as enthusiastic in asserting
their sovereignty over Vermont as they were in
declaring their independence of Britain. Morris,
however, was very half-hearted in pushing the
affair before Congress. He doubted if Congress
had the power, and he knew it lacked the will,
to move in the matter at all; and besides he
did not sympathize with the position taken by
his State. He was wise enough to see that the
Vermonters had much of the right on their side
in addition to the great fact of possession; and
that New York would be probably unable to
employ force enough to conquer them. Clinton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
was a true type of the separatist or states-rights
politician of that day: he cared little how the
national weal was affected by the quarrel; and
he was far more anxious to bluster than to fight
over the matter, to which end he kept besieging
the delegates in Congress with useless petitions.
In a letter to him Morris put the case with his
usual plainness, telling him that it was perfectly
idle to keep worrying Congress to take action,
for it would certainly not do so, and if it did
render a decision, the Vermonters would no
more respect it than they would the Pope's
Bull. He went on to show his characteristic
contempt for half-measures, and capacity for
striking straight at the root of things: "Either
let these people alone, or conquer them. I prefer
the latter; but I doubt the means. If we
have the means let them be used, and let Congress
deliberate and decide, or deliberate without
deciding,&mdash;it is of no consequence. Success
will sanctify every operation.... If we have
not the means of conquering these people we
must let them alone. We must continue our
impotent threats, or we must make a treaty....
If we continue our threats they will either
hate or despise us, and perhaps both.... On
the whole, then, my conclusion is here, as on
most other human affairs, act decisively, fight
or submit&mdash;conquer or treat." Morris was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
right; the treaty was finally made, and Vermont
became an independent State.</p>

<p>But the small politicians of New York would
not forgive him for the wisdom and the broad
feeling of nationality he showed on this and so
many other questions; and they defeated him
when he was a candidate for reëlection to Congress
at the end of 1779. The charge they
urged against him was that he devoted his time
wholly to the service of the nation at large, and
not to that of New York in particular; his very
devotion to the public business, which had kept
him from returning to the State, being brought
forward to harm him. Arguments of this kind
are common enough even at the present day,
and effective too, among that numerous class
of men with narrow minds and selfish hearts.
Many an able and upright Congressman since
Morris has been sacrificed because his constituents
found he was fitted to do the exact work
needed; because he showed himself capable of
serving the whole nation, and did not devote
his time to advancing the interests of only a
portion thereof.</p>

<h3>FINANCES: THE TREATY OF PEACE.</h3>

<p>At the end of 1779 Morris was thus retired
to private life; and, having by this time made
many friends in Philadelphia, he took up his
abode in that city. His leaving Congress was
small loss to himself, as that body was rapidly
sinking into a condition of windy decrepitude.</p>

<p>He at once began working at his profession,
and also threw himself with eager zest into
every attainable form of gayety and amusement,
for he was of a most pleasure-loving temperament,
very fond of society, and a great favorite
in the little American world of wit and fashion.
But although in private life, he nevertheless
kept his grip on public affairs, and devoted
himself to the finances, which were in a most
wretched state. He could not keep out of public
life; he probably agreed with Jay, who, on
hearing that he was again a private citizen,
wrote him to "remember that Achilles made
no figure at the spinning-wheel." At any rate,
as early as February, 1780, he came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
front once more as the author of a series of
essays on the finances. They were published
in Philadelphia, and attracted the attention of
all thinking men by their soundness. In fact
it was in our monetary affairs that the key to
the situation was to be found; for, had we been
willing to pay honestly and promptly the necessary
war expenses, we should have ended the
struggle in short order. But the niggardliness
as well as the real poverty, of the people, the
jealousies of the states, kept aflame by the
states-rights leaders for their own selfish purposes,
and the foolish ideas of most of the congressional
delegates on all money matters, combined
to keep our treasury in a pitiable condition.</p>

<p>Morris tried to show the people at large the
advantage of submitting to reasonable taxation,
while at the same time combating some of the
theories entertained as well by themselves as by
their congressional representatives. He began
by discussing with great clearness what money
really is, how far coin can be replaced by paper,
the interdependence of money and credit, and
other elementary points in reference to which
most of his fellow-citizens seemed to possess
wonderfully mixed ideas. He attacked the efforts
of Congress to make their currency legal
tender; and then showed the utter futility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
one of the pet schemes of revolutionary financial
wisdom, the regulation of prices by law. Hard
times, then as now, always produced not only a
large debtor class, but also a corresponding number
of political demagogues who truckled to
it; and both demagogue and debtor, when they
clamored for laws which should "relieve" the
latter, meant thereby laws which would enable
him to swindle his creditor. The people, moreover,
liked to lay the blame for their misfortunes
neither on fate nor on themselves, but on some
unfortunate outsider; and they were especially
apt to attack as "monopolists" the men who
had purchased necessary supplies in large quantities
to profit by their rise in price. Accordingly
they passed laws against them; and Morris
showed in his essays the unwisdom of such
legislation, while not defending for a moment
the men who looked on the misfortunes of their
country solely as offering a field for their own
harvesting.</p>

<p>He ended by drawing out an excellent scheme
of taxation; but, unfortunately, the people
were too short-sighted to submit to any measure
of the sort, no matter how wise and necessary.
One of the pleas he made for his scheme was,
that something of the sort would be absolutely
necessary for the preservation of the Federal
Union, "which," he wrote, "in my poor opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
will greatly depend upon the management
of the revenue." He showed with his usual
clearness the need of obtaining, for financial as
well as for all other reasons, a firmer union, as
the existing confederation bade fair to become,
as its enemies had prophesied, a rope of sand.
He also foretold graphically the misery that
would ensue&mdash;and that actually did ensue&mdash;when
the pressure from a foreign foe should
cease, and the states should be resolved into a
disorderly league of petty, squabbling communities.
In ending he remarked bitterly: "The
articles of confederation were formed when the
attachment to Congress was warm and great.
The framers of them, therefore, seem to have
been only solicitous how to provide against the
power of that body, which, by means of their
foresight and care, now exists by mere courtesy
and sufferance."</p>

<p>Although Morris was not able to convert
Congress to the ways of sound thinking, his
ability and clearness impressed themselves on
all the best men; notably on Robert Morris,&mdash;who
was no relation of his, by the way,&mdash;the
first in the line of American statesmen who have
been great in finance; a man whose services to
our treasury stand on a par, if not with those
of Hamilton, at least with those of Gallatin
and John Sherman. Congress had just established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
four departments, with secretaries at the
head of each. The two most important were
the Departments of Foreign Affairs and of
Finance. Livingstone was given the former,
while Robert Morris received the latter; and
immediately afterwards appointed Gouverneur
Morris as Assistant Financier, at a salary of
eighteen hundred and fifty dollars a year.</p>

<p>Morris accepted this appointment, and remained
in office for three years and a half, until
the beginning of 1785. He threw himself
heart and soul into the work, helping his chief
in every way; and in particular giving him
invaluable assistance in the establishment of
the "Bank of North America," which Congress
was persuaded to incorporate,&mdash;an institution
which was the first of its kind in the country.
It was of wonderful effect in restoring the
public credit, and was absolutely invaluable in
the financial operations undertaken by the
secretary.</p>

<p>When, early in 1782, the secretary was directed
by Congress, to present to that body a
report on the foreign coins circulating in the
country, it was prepared and sent in by Gouverneur
Morris, and he accompanied it with a
plan for an American coinage. The postscript
was the really important part of the document,
and the plan therein set forth was made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
basis of our present coinage system, although
not until several years later, and then only with
important modifications, suggested, for the most
part, by Jefferson.</p>

<p>Although his plan was modified, it still
remains true that Gouverneur Morris was the
founder of our national coinage. He introduced
the system of decimal notation, invented
the word "cent" to express one of the smaller
coins, and nationalized the already familiar
word "dollar." His plan, however, was a little
too abstruse for the common mind, the unit
being made so small that a large sum would
have had to be expressed in a very great number
of figures, and there being five or six different
kinds of new coins, some of them not
simple multiples of each other. Afterwards he
proposed as a modification a system of pounds,
or dollars, and doits, the doit answering to our
present mill, while providing also an ingenious
arrangement by which the money of account
was to differ from the money of coinage. Jefferson
changed the system by grafting on it the
dollar as a unit, and simplifying it; and Hamilton
perfected it further.</p>

<p>To understand the advantage, as well as the
boldness, of Morris's scheme, we must keep in
mind the horrible condition of our currency at
that time. We had no proper coins of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
own; nothing but hopelessly depreciated paper
bills, a mass of copper, and some clipped and
counterfeited gold and silver coin from the
mints of England, France, Spain, and even
Germany. Dollars, pounds, shillings, doubloons,
ducats, moidores, joes, crowns, pistareens, coppers,
and sous, circulated indifferently, and with
various values in each colony. A dollar was
worth six shillings in Massachusetts, eight in
New York, seven and sixpence in Pennsylvania,
six again in Virginia, eight again in North
Carolina, thirty-two and a half in South Carolina,
and five in Georgia. The government itself
had to resort to clipping in one of its most
desperate straits; and at last people would only
take payment by weight of gold or silver.</p>

<p>Morris, in his report, dwelt especially on
three points: first, that the new money should
be easily intelligible to the multitude, and
should, therefore, bear a close relation to the
coins already existing, as otherwise its sudden
introduction would bring business to a stand-still;
and would excite distrust and suspicion
everywhere, particularly among the poorest and
most ignorant, the day-laborers, the farm servants,
and the hired help. Second, that its lowest
divisible sum, or unit, should be very small,
so that the price and the value of little things
could be made proportionate; and third, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
as far as possible the money should increase
in decimal ratio. The Spanish dollar was the
coin most widely circulated, while retaining
everywhere about the same value. Accordingly
he took this, and then sought for a unit that
would go evenly into it, as well as into the various
shillings, disregarding the hopelessly aberrant
shilling of South Carolina. Such a unit
was a quarter of a grain of pure silver, equal to
the one fourteen hundred and fortieth part of a
dollar; it was not, of course, necessary to have
it exactly represented in coin. On the contrary,
he proposed to strike two copper pieces,
respectively of five and eight units, to be known
as <i>fives</i> and <i>eights</i>. Two <i>eights</i> would then
make a penny in Pennsylvania, and three <i>eights</i>
one in Georgia, while three <i>fives</i> would make one
in New York, and four would make one in Massachusetts.
Morris's great aim was, while establishing
uniform coins for the entire Union, to
get rid of the fractional remainders in translating
the old currencies into the new; and in addition
his reckoning adapted itself to the different
systems in the different states, as well
as to the different coins in use. But he introduced
an entirely new system of coinage,
and moreover used therein the names of several
old coins while giving them new values. His
originally proposed table of currency was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Proposed money system">
<tr><td align="left">One crown = ten dollars, or</td><td align="right">10,000</td><td align="center">units.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">One dollar = ten bills, or</td><td align="right">1,000</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">One bill = ten pence, or</td><td align="right">100</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">One penny = ten quarters, or</td><td align="right">10</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">One quarter =</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>But he proposed that for convenience other
coins should be struck, like the copper <i>five</i> and
<i>eight</i> above spoken of, and he afterwards altered
his names. He then called the bill of one hundred
units a <i>cent</i>, making it consist of twenty-five
grains of silver and two of copper, being
thus the lowest silver coin. Five <i>cents</i> were to
make a <i>quint</i>, and ten a <i>mark</i>.</p>

<p>Congress, according to its custom, received
the report, applauded it, and did nothing in the
matter. Shortly afterwards, however, Jefferson
took it up, when the whole subject was referred
to a committee of which he was a member. He
highly approved of Morris's plan, and took from
it the idea of a decimal system, and the use of
the words "dollar" and "cent." But he considered
Morris's unit too small, and preferred to
take as his own the Spanish dollar, which was
already known to all the people, its value being
uniform and well understood. Then, by keeping
strictly to the decimal system, and dividing
the dollar into one hundred parts, he got cents
for our fractional currency. He thus introduced
a simpler system than that of Morris, with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
existing and well-understood unit, instead of
an imaginary one that would have to be, for
the first time, brought to the knowledge of the
people, and which might be adopted only with
reluctance. On the other hand, Jefferson's
system failed entirely to provide for the extension
of the old currencies in the terms of
the new without the use of fractions. On this
account Morris vehemently opposed it, but it
was nevertheless adopted. He foretold, what
actually came to pass, that the people would be
very reluctant to throw away their local moneys
in order to take up a general money which bore
no special relation to them. For half a century
afterwards the people clung to their absurd
shillings and sixpences, the government itself,
in its post-office transactions, being obliged to
recognize the obsolete terms in vogue in certain
localities. Some curious pieces circulated freely
up to the time of the Civil War. Still, Jefferson's
plan worked admirably in the end.</p>

<p>All the time he was working so hard at the
finances, Morris nevertheless continued to enjoy
himself to the full in the society of Philadelphia.
Imperious, light-hearted, good-looking,
well-dressed, he ranked as a wit among men, as
a beau among women. He was equally sought
for dances and dinners. He was a fine scholar
and a polished gentleman; a capital story-teller;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and had just a touch of erratic levity
that served to render him still more charming.
Occasionally he showed whimsical peculiarities,
usually about very small things, that brought
him into trouble; and one such freak cost him
a serious injury. In his capacity of young man
of fashion, he used to drive about town in a
phaeton with a pair of small, spirited horses;
and because of some whim, he would not allow
the groom to stand at their heads. So one
day they took fright, ran, threw him out, and
broke his leg. The leg had to be amputated,
and he was ever afterwards forced to wear a
wooden one. However, he took his loss with
most philosophic cheerfulness, and even bore
with equanimity the condolences of those exasperating
individuals, of a species by no means
peculiar to revolutionary times, who endeavored
to prove to him the manifest falsehood
that such an accident was "all for the best."
To one of these dreary gentlemen he responded,
with disconcerting vivacity, that his visitor had
so handsomely argued the advantage of being
entirely legless as to make him almost tempted
to part with his remaining limb; and to another
he announced that at least there was the
compensation that he would be a <i>steadier</i> man
with one leg than with two. Wild accounts
of the accident got about, which rather irritated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
him, and in answer to a letter from Jay
he wrote: "I suppose it was Deane who wrote
to you from France about the loss of my leg.
His account is facetious. Let it pass. The
leg is gone, and there is an end of the matter."
His being crippled did not prevent him
from going about in society very nearly as
much as ever; and society in Philadelphia was
at the moment gayer than in any other American
city. Indeed Jay, a man of Puritanic morality,
wrote to Morris somewhat gloomily to
inquire about "the rapid progress of luxury at
Philadelphia;" to which his younger friend,
who highly appreciated the good things of life,
replied light-heartedly: "With respect to our
taste for luxury, do not grieve about it. Luxury
is not so bad a thing as it is often supposed
to be; and if it were, still we must follow
the course of things, and turn to advantage
what exists, since we have not the power to
annihilate or create. The very definition of
'luxury' is as difficult as the suppression of it."
In another letter he remarked that he thought
there were quite as many knaves among the
men who went on foot as there were among
those who drove in carriages.</p>

<p>Jay at this time, having been successively a
member of the Continental Congress, the New
York Legislature, and the State Constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Convention, having also been the first chief
justice of his native state, and then president
of the Continental Congress, had been
sent as our minister to Spain. Morris always
kept up an intimate correspondence with him.
It is noticeable that the three great revolutionary
statesmen from New York, Hamilton,
Jay, and Morris, always kept on good terms,
and always worked together; while the friendship
between two, Jay and Morris, was very
close.</p>

<p>The two men, in their correspondence, now
and then touched on other than state matters.
One of Jay's letters which deals with the education
of his children would be most healthful
reading for those Americans of the present day
who send their children to be brought up
abroad in Swiss schools, or English and German
universities. He writes: "I think the youth of
every free, civilized country should be educated
in it, and not permitted to travel out of it
until age has made them so cool and firm as to
retain their national and moral impressions.
American youth may possibly form proper and
perhaps useful friendships in European seminaries,
but I think not so <i>probably</i> as among
their fellow-citizens, with whom they are to
grow up, whom it will be useful for them to
know and be early known to, and with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
they are to be engaged in the business of active
life.... I do not hesitate to prefer an American
education." The longer Jay stayed away,
the more devoted he became to America. He
had a good, hearty, honest contempt for the
miserable "cosmopolitanism" so much affected
by the feebler folk of fashion. As he said he
"could never become so far a citizen of the
world as to view every part of it with equal
regard," for "his affections were deep-rooted
in America," and he always asserted that he
had never seen anything in Europe to cause
him to abate his prejudices in favor of his own
land.</p>

<p>Jay had a very hard time at the Spanish
court, which, he wrote Morris, had "little
money, less wisdom, and no credit." Spain, although
fighting England, was bitterly jealous
of the United States, fearing most justly our
aggressive spirit, and desiring to keep the
lower Mississippi valley entirely under its own
control. Jay, a statesman of intensely national
spirit, was determined to push our boundaries
as far westward as possible; he insisted on
their reaching to the Mississippi, and on our
having the right to navigate that stream.
Morris did not agree with him, and on this
subject, as has been already said, he for once
showed less than his usual power of insight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
into the future. He wrote Jay that it was
absurd to quarrel about a country inhabited
only by red men, and to claim "a territory we
cannot occupy, a navigation we cannot enjoy."
He also ventured the curiously false prediction
that, if the territory beyond the Alleghanies
should ever be filled up, it would be by a population
drawn from the whole world, not one
hundredth part of it American, which would
immediately become an independent and rival
nation. However, he could not make Jay
swerve a handsbreadth from his position about
our western boundaries; though on every other
point the two were in hearty accord.</p>

<p>In relating and forecasting the military
situation, Morris was more happy. He was
peculiarly interested in Greene, and from the
outset foretold the final success of his Southern
campaign. In a letter written March 31,
1781, after the receipt of the news of the
battle of Guilford Court-house, he describes
to Jay Greene's forces and prospects. His
troops included, he writes, "from 1,500 to 2,000
continentals, many of them raw, and somewhat
more of militia than regular troops,&mdash;the
whole of these almost in a state of nature, and
of whom it ought to be said, as by Hamlet to
Horatio, 'Thou hast no other revenue but thy
good spirits to feed and clothe thee.'" The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
militia he styled the "<i>fruges consumere nati</i>
of an army." He then showed the necessity
of the battle being fought, on account of the
fluctuating state of the militia, the incapacity
of the state governments to help themselves,
the poverty of the country ("so that the very
teeth of the enemy defend them, especially in
retreat,"), and above all, because a defeat was
of little consequence to us, while it would ruin
the enemy. He wrote: "There is no loss in
fighting away two or three hundred men who
would go home if they were not put in the
way of being knocked on the head.... These
are unfeeling reflections. I would apologize
for them to any one who did not know that I
have at least enough of sensibility. The gush
of sentiment will not alter the nature of things,
and the business of the statesman is more to
reason than to feel." Morris was always confident
that we should win in the end, and
sometimes thought a little punishment really
did our people good. When Cornwallis was in
Virginia he wrote: "The enemy are scourging
the Virginians, at least those of Lower Virginia.
This is distressing, but will have some
good consequences. In the mean time the
delegates of Virginia make as many lamentations
as ever Jeremiah did, and to as good
purpose perhaps."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
The war was drawing to an end. Great
Britain had begun the struggle with everything&mdash;allies,
numbers, wealth&mdash;in her favor;
but now, towards the close, the odds were all
the other way. The French were struggling
with her on equal terms for the mastery of the
seas; the Spaniards were helping the French,
and were bending every energy to carry through
successfully the great siege of Gibraltar; the
Dutch had joined their ancient enemies, and
their fleet fought a battle with the English,
which, for bloody indecisiveness, rivaled the actions
when Van Tromp and De Ruyter held the
Channel against Blake and Monk. In India
the name of Hyder Ali had become a very
nightmare of horror to the British. In America,
the centre of the war, the day had gone
conclusively against the Island folk. Greene
had doggedly fought and marched his way
through the Southern States with his ragged,
under-fed, badly armed troops; he had been
beaten in three obstinate battles, had each time
inflicted a greater relative loss than he received,
and, after retiring in good order a short distance,
had always ended by pursuing his lately
victorious foes; at the close of the campaign he
had completely reconquered the Southern States
by sheer capacity for standing punishment, and
had cooped up the remaining British force in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Charleston. In the Northern States the British
held Newport and New York, but could not
penetrate elsewhere; while at Yorktown their
ablest general was obliged to surrender his
whole army to the overwhelming force brought
against him by Washington's masterly strategy.</p>

<p>Yet England, hemmed in by the ring of her
foes, fronted them all with a grand courage. In
her veins the Berserker blood was up, and she
hailed each new enemy with grim delight, exerting
to the full her warlike strength. Single-handed
she kept them all at bay, and repaid
with crippling blows the injuries they had done
her. In America alone the tide ran too strongly
to be turned. But Holland was stripped of all
her colonies; in the East, Sir Eyre Coote beat
down Hyder Ali, and taught Moslem and
Hindoo alike that they could not shake off the
grasp of the iron hands that held India. Rodney
won back for his country the supremacy of
the ocean in that great sea-fight where he shattered
the splendid French navy; and the long
siege of Gibraltar closed with the crushing overthrow
of the assailants. So, with bloody honor,
England ended the most disastrous war she had
ever waged.</p>

<p>The war had brought forth many hard fighters,
but only one great commander,&mdash;Washington.
For the rest, on land, Cornwallis, Greene,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Rawdon, and possibly Lafayette and Rochambeau,
might all rank as fairly good generals,
probably in the order named, although many
excellent critics place Greene first. At sea
Rodney and the Bailli de Suffren won the
honors; the latter stands beside Duquesne
and Tourville in the roll of French admirals;
while Rodney was a true latter-day buccaneer,
as fond of fighting as of plundering, and a first-rate
hand at both. Neither ranks with such
mighty sea-chiefs as Nelson, nor yet with Blake,
Farragut, or Tegethof.</p>

<p>All parties were tired of the war; peace was
essential to all. But of all, America was most
resolute to win what she had fought for; and
America had been the most successful so far.
English historians&mdash;even so generally impartial
a writer as Mr. Lecky&mdash;are apt greatly to
exaggerate our relative exhaustion, and try to
prove it by quoting from the American leaders
every statement that shows despondency and
suffering. If they applied the same rule to
their own side, they would come to the conclusion
that the British empire was at that time
on the brink of dissolution. Of course we had
suffered very heavily, and had blundered badly;
but in both respects we were better off than
our antagonists. Mr. Lecky is right in bestowing
unstinted praise on our diplomatists for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
hardihood and success with which they insisted
on all our demands being granted; but he is
wrong when he says or implies that the military
situation did not warrant their attitude.
Of all the contestants, America was the most
willing to continue the fight rather than yield
her rights. Morris expressed the general feeling
when he wrote to Jay, on August 6, 1782:
"Nobody will be thankful for any peace but a
very good one. This <i>they</i> should have thought
on who made war with the Republic. I am
among the number who would be extremely
ungrateful for the grant of a bad peace. My
public and private character will both concert
to render the sentiment coming from me unsuspected.
Judge, then, of others, judge of the
many-headed fool who can feel no more than
his own sorrowing.... I wish that while the
war lasts it may be real war, and that when
peace comes it may be real peace." As to our
military efficiency, we may take Washington's
word (in a letter to Jay of October 18, 1782):
"I am certain it will afford you pleasure to
know that our army is better organized, disciplined,
and clothed than it has been at any
period since the commencement of the war.
This you may be assured is the fact."</p>

<p>Another mistake of English historians&mdash;again
likewise committed by Mr. Lecky&mdash;comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in their laying so much stress on the help rendered
to the Americans by their allies, while at
the same time speaking as if England had none.
As a matter of fact, England would have stood
no chance at all had the contest been strictly
confined to British troops on the one hand, and
to the rebellious colonists on the other. There
were more German auxiliaries in the British
ranks than there were French allies in the
American; the loyalists, including the regularly
enlisted loyalists as well as the militia who
took part in the various Tory uprisings, were
probably more numerous still. The withdrawal
of all Hessians, Tories, and Indians from the
British army would have been cheaply purchased
by the loss of our own foreign allies.</p>

<p>The European powers were even a shade
more anxious for peace than we were; and to
conduct the negotiations for our side, we chose
three of our greatest statesmen,&mdash;Franklin,
Adams, and Jay.</p>

<p>Congress, in appointing our commissioners,
had, with little regard for the national dignity,
given them instructions which, if obeyed, would
have rendered them completely subservient to
France; for they were directed to undertake
nothing in the negotiations without the knowledge
and concurrence of the French cabinet,
and in all decisions to be ultimately governed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
by the advice of that body. Morris fiercely
resented such servile subservience, and in a
letter to Jay denounced Congress with well-justified
warmth, writing: "That the proud
should prostitute the very little dignity this
poor country is possessed of would be indeed
astounding, if we did not know the near alliance
between pride and meanness. Men who have
too little spirit to demand of their constituents
that they do their duty, who have sufficient
humility to beg a paltry pittance at the hands
of any and every sovereign,&mdash;such men will
always be ready to pay the price which vanity
shall demand from the vain." Jay promptly
persuaded his colleagues to unite with him in
disregarding the instructions of Congress on
this point; had he not done so, the dignity of
our government would, as he wrote Morris,
"have been in the dust." Franklin was at first
desirous of yielding obedience to the command;
but Adams immediately joined Jay in repudiating
it.</p>

<p>We had waged war against Britain, with
France and Spain as allies; but in making
peace we had to strive for our rights against
our friends almost as much as against our enemies.
There was much generous and disinterested
enthusiasm for America among Frenchmen
individually; but the French government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
with which alone we were to deal in making
peace, had acted throughout from purely selfish
motives, and in reality did not care an atom for
American rights. We owed France no more
gratitude for taking our part than she owed us
for giving her an opportunity of advancing her
own interests, and striking a severe blow at an
old-time enemy and rival. As for Spain, she
disliked us quite as much as she did England.</p>

<p>The peace negotiations brought all this out
very clearly. The great French minister Vergennes,
who dictated the policy of his court all
through the contest, cared nothing for the revolutionary
colonists themselves; but he was bent
upon securing them their independence, so as
to weaken England, and he was also bent upon
keeping them from gaining too much strength,
so that they might always remain dependent
allies of France. He wished to establish the
"balance of power" system in America. The
American commissioners he at first despised for
their blunt, truthful straightforwardness, which
he, trained in the school of deceit, and a thorough
believer in every kind of finesse and
double-dealing, mistook for boorishness; later
on, he learned to his chagrin that they were
able as well as honest, and that their resolution,
skill, and far-sightedness made them,
where their own deepest interests were concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
over-matches for the subtle diplomats of
Europe.</p>

<p>America, then, was determined to secure not
only independence, but also a chance to grow
into a great continental nation; she wished her
boundaries fixed at the great lakes and the
Mississippi; she also asked for the free navigation
of the latter to the Gulf, and for a share in
the fisheries. Spain did not even wish that we
should be made independent; she hoped to be
compensated at our expense, for her failure to
take Gibraltar; and she desired that we should
be kept so weak as to hinder us from being
aggressive. Her fear of us, by the way, was
perfectly justifiable, for the greatest part of
our present territory lies within what were
nominally Spanish limits a hundred years ago.
France, as the head of a great coalition, wanted
to keep on good terms with both her allies; but,
as Gerard, the French minister at Washington,
said: if France had to choose between the two,
"the decision would not be in favor of the
United States." She wished to secure for
America independence, but she wished also to
keep the new nation so weak that it would "feel
the need of sureties, allies, and protectors."
France desired to exclude our people from the
fisheries, to deprive us of half our territories
by making the Alleghanies our western boundaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and to secure to Spain the undisputed
control of the navigation of the Mississippi. It
was not to the interest of France and Spain that
we should be a great and formidable people, and
very naturally they would not help us to become
one. There is no need of blaming them
for their conduct; but it would have been rank
folly to have been guided by their wishes. Our
true policy was admirably summed up by Jay
in his letters to Livingston, where he says:
"Let us be honest and grateful to France, but
let us think for ourselves.... Since we have
assumed a place in the political firmament, let
us move like a primary and not a secondary
planet." Fortunately, England's own self-interest
made her play into our hands; as Fox
put it, it was necessary for her to "insist in
the strongest manner that, if America is independent,
she must be so of the whole world.
No secret, tacit, or ostensible connection with
France."</p>

<p>Our statesmen won; we got all we asked,
as much to the astonishment of France as of
England; we proved even more successful in
diplomacy than in arms. As Fox had hoped,
we became independent not only of England,
but of all the world; we were not entangled
as a dependent subordinate in the policy of
France, nor did we sacrifice our western boundary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to Spain. It was a great triumph; greater
than any that had been won by our soldiers.
Franklin had a comparatively small share in
gaining it; the glory of carrying through successfully
the most important treaty we ever
negotiated belongs to Jay and Adams, and especially
to Jay.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>THE FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p>Before peace was established, Morris had
been appointed a commissioner to treat for the
exchange of prisoners. Nothing came of his
efforts, however, the British and Americans
being utterly unable to come to any agreement.
Both sides had been greatly exasperated,&mdash;the
British by the Americans' breach of faith
about Burgoyne's troops, and the Americans
by the inhuman brutality with which their
captive countrymen had been treated. An
amusing feature of the affair was a conversation
between Morris and the British general,
Dalrymple, wherein the former assured the
latter rather patronizingly that the British
"still remained a great people, a very great
people," and that "they would undoubtedly
still hold their rank in Europe." He would
have been surprised, had he known not only
that the stubborn Island folk were destined
soon to hold a higher rank in Europe than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
ever before, but that from their loins other
nations, broad as continents, were to spring, so
that the South Seas should become an English
ocean, and that over a fourth of the world's
surface there should be spoken the tongue of
Pitt and Washington.</p>

<p>No sooner was peace declared, and the immediate
and pressing danger removed, than the
confederation relapsed into a loose knot of communities
as quarrelsome as they were contemptible.
The states-rights men for the moment
had things all their own way, and speedily
reduced us to the level afterwards reached by
the South-American republics. Each commonwealth
set up for itself, and tried to oppress
its neighbors; not one had a creditable history
for the next four years; while the career of
Rhode Island in particular can only be properly
described as infamous. We refused to pay our
debts, we would not even pay our army; and
mob violence flourished rankly. As a natural
result the European powers began to take advantage
of our weakness and division.</p>

<p>All our great men saw the absolute need of
establishing a National Union&mdash;not a league
or a confederation&mdash;if the country was to be
saved. None felt this more strongly than
Morris; and no one was more hopeful of the
final result. Jay had written to him as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
need of "raising and maintaining a national
spirit in America;" and he wrote in reply,
at different times:<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "Much of convulsion will
ensue, yet it must terminate in giving to government
that power without which government
is but a name.... This country has never yet
been known to Europe, and God knows whether
it ever will be. To England it is less known
than to any other part of Europe, because they
constantly view it through a medium of either
prejudice or faction. True it is that the general
government wants energy, and equally
true it is that the want will eventually be supplied.
A national spirit is the natural result
of national existence; <i>and although some of the
present generation may feel the result of colonial
oppositions of opinion, that generation will die
away, and give place to a race of Americans</i>.
On this occasion, as on others, Great Britain
is our best friend; and, by seizing the critical
moment when we were about to divide, she has
shown us the dreadful consequences of division....
Indeed, my friend, nothing can do us
so much good as to convince the Eastern and
Southern States how necessary it is to give
proper force to the federal government, and
nothing will so soon operate that conviction as
foreign efforts to restrain the navigation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
one and the commerce of the other." The last
sentence referred to the laws aimed at our
trade by Great Britain, and by other powers
as well,&mdash;symptoms of outside hostility which
made us at once begin to draw together again.</p>

<p>Money troubles grew apace, and produced
the usual crop of crude theories and of vicious
and dishonest legislation in accordance therewith.
Lawless outbreaks became common, and
in Massachusetts culminated in actual rebellion.
The mass of the people were rendered hostile
to any closer union by their ignorance, their
jealousy, and the general particularistic bent
of their minds,&mdash;this last being merely a vicious
graft on, or rather outgrowth of, the love
of freedom inborn in the race. Their leaders
were enthusiasts of pure purpose and unsteady
mental vision; they were followed by the mass
of designing politicians, who feared that their
importance would be lost if their sphere of action
should be enlarged. Among these leaders
the three most important were, in New York
George Clinton, and in Massachusetts and Virginia
two much greater men&mdash;Samuel Adams
and Patrick Henry. All three had done excellent
service at the beginning of the revolutionary
troubles. Patrick Henry lived to redeem
himself, almost in his last hour, by the noble
stand he took in aid of Washington against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
democratic nullification agitation of Jefferson
and Madison; but the usefulness of each of the
other two was limited to the early portion of
his career.</p>

<p>Like every other true patriot and statesman,
Morris did all in his power to bring into one
combination the varied interests favorable to
the formation of a government that should be
strong and responsible as well as free. The
public creditors and the soldiers of the army&mdash;whose
favorite toasts were: "A hoop to the
barrel," and "Cement to the Union"&mdash;were
the two classes most sensible of the advantages
of such a government; and to each of these
Morris addressed himself when he proposed to
consolidate the public debt, both to private
citizens and to the soldiers, and to make it a
charge on the United States, and not on the
several separate states.</p>

<p>In consequence of the activity and ability
with which he advocated a firmer Union, the
extreme states-rights men were especially hostile
to him; and certain of their number assailed
him with bitter malignity, both then and
afterwards. One accusation was, that he had
improper connections with the public creditors.
This was a pure slander, absolutely without
foundation, and not supported by even the pretence
of proof. Another accusation was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
he favored the establishment of a monarchy.
This was likewise entirely untrue. Morris was
not a sentimental political theorist; he was an
eminently practical&mdash;that is, useful&mdash;statesman,
who saw with unusual clearness that each
people must have a government suited to its
own individual character, and to the stage of
political and social development it had reached.
He realized that a nation must be governed
according to the actual needs and capacities
of its citizens, not according to any abstract
theory or set of ideal principles. He would
have dismissed with contemptuous laughter the
ideas of those Americans who at the present
day believe that Anglo-Saxon democracy can
be applied successfully to a half-savage negroid
people in Hayti, or of those Englishmen who
consider seriously the proposition to renovate
Turkey by giving her representative institutions
and a parliamentary government. He
understood and stated that a monarchy "did
not consist with the taste and temper of the
people" in America, and he believed in establishing
a form of government that did. Like
almost every other statesman of the day, the
perverse obstinacy of the extreme particularist
section at times made him downhearted, and
caused him almost to despair of a good government
being established; and like every sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
man he would have preferred almost any strong,
orderly government to the futile anarchy
towards which the ultra states-rights men or
separatists tended. Had these last ever finally
obtained the upper hand, either in revolutionary
or post-revolutionary times, either in
1787 or 1861, the fact would have shown conclusively
that Americans were unfitted for republicanism
and self-government. An orderly
monarchy would certainly be preferable to a
republic of the epileptic Spanish-American
type. The extreme doctrinaires, who are fiercest
in declaiming in favor of freedom are in
reality its worst foes, far more dangerous than
any absolute monarchy ever can be. When
liberty becomes license, some form of one-man
power is not far distant.</p>

<p>The one great reason for our having succeeded
as no other people ever has, is to be
found in that common sense which has enabled
us to preserve the largest possible individual
freedom on the one hand, while showing an
equally remarkable capacity for combination
on the other. We have committed plenty of
faults, but we have seen and remedied them.
Our very doctrinaires have usually acted much
more practically than they have talked. Jefferson,
when in power, adopted most of the Federalist
theories, and became markedly hostile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to the nullification movements at whose birth
he had himself officiated. We have often blundered
badly in the beginning, but we have always
come out well in the end. The Dutch,
when they warred for freedom from Spanish
rule, showed as much short-sighted selfishness
and bickering jealousy as even our own revolutionary
ancestors, and only a part remained
faithful to the end: as a result, but one section
won independence, while the Netherlands were
divided, and never grasped the power that
should have been theirs. As for the Spanish-Americans,
they split up hopelessly almost before
they were free, and, though they bettered
their condition a little, yet lost nine tenths of
what they had gained. Scotland and Ireland,
when independent, were nests of savages. All
the follies our forefathers committed can be
paralleled elsewhere, but their successes are
unique.</p>

<p>So it was in the few years immediately succeeding
the peace by which we won our independence.
The mass of the people wished for
no closer union than was to be found in a lax
confederation; but they had the good sense to
learn the lesson taught by the weakness and
lawlessness they saw around them; they reluctantly
made up their minds to the need of a
stronger government, and when they had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
come to their decision, neither demagogue nor
doctrinaire could swerve them from it.</p>

<p>The national convention to form a Constitution
met in May, 1787; and rarely in the
world's history has there been a deliberative
body which contained so many remarkable men,
or produced results so lasting and far-reaching.
The Congress whose members signed the Declaration
of Independence had but cleared the
ground on which the framers of the Constitution
were to build. Among the delegates in
attendance, easily first stood Washington and
Franklin,&mdash;two of that great American trio in
which Lincoln is the third. Next came Hamilton
from New York, having as colleagues a
couple of mere obstructionists sent by the Clintonians
to handicap him. From Pennsylvania
came Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris;
from Virginia, Madison; from South Carolina,
Rutledge and the Pinckneys; and so on through
the other states. Some of the most noted
statesmen were absent, however. Adams and
Jefferson were abroad. Jay was acting as Secretary
for Foreign Affairs; in which capacity,
by the way, he had shown most unlooked-for
weakness in yielding to Spanish demands about
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Two years after taking part in the proceedings
of the American Constitutional Convention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Morris witnessed the opening of the States
General of France. He thoroughly appreciated
the absolute and curious contrast offered by
these two bodies, each so big with fate for all
mankind. The men who predominated in and
shaped the actions of the first belonged to a
type not uncommonly brought forth by a people
already accustomed to freedom at a crisis in
the struggle to preserve or extend its liberties.
During the past few centuries this type had appeared
many times among the liberty loving
nations who dwelt on the shores of the Baltic
and the North Sea; and our forefathers represented
it in its highest and most perfect shapes.
It is a type only to be found among men already
trained to govern themselves as well as
others. The American statesmen were the
kinsfolk and fellows of Hampden and Pym, of
William the Silent and John of Barneveldt.
Save love of freedom, they had little in common
with the closet philosophers, the enthusiastic
visionaries, and the selfish demagogues who in
France helped pull up the flood-gates of an all-swallowing
torrent. They were great men; but
it was less the greatness of mere genius than
that springing from the union of strong, virile
qualities with steadfast devotion to a high ideal.
In certain respects they were ahead of all their
European compeers; yet they preserved virtues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
forgotten or sneered at by the contemporaneous
generation of trans-Atlantic leaders. They
wrought for the future as surely as did the
French Jacobins; but their spirit was the spirit
of the Long Parliament. They were resolute to
free themselves from the tyranny of man; but
they had not unlearned the reverence felt by
their fathers for their fathers' God. They were
sincerely religious. The advanced friends of freedom
abroad scoffed at religion, and would have
laughed outright at a proposition to gain help
for their cause by prayer; but to the founders
of our Constitution, when matters were at a
deadlock, and the outcome looked almost hopeless,
it seemed a most fit and proper thing that
one of the chief of their number should propose
to invoke to aid them a wisdom greater than
the wisdom of human beings. Even those
among their descendants who no longer share
their trusting faith may yet well do regretful
homage to a religious spirit so deep-rooted and
so strongly tending to bring out a pure and
high morality. The statesmen who met in
1787 were earnestly patriotic. They unselfishly
desired the welfare of their countrymen. They
were cool, resolute men, of strong convictions,
with clear insight into the future. They were
thoroughly acquainted with the needs of the
community for which they were to act. Above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
all they possessed that inestimable quality, so
characteristic of their race, hard-headed common
sense. Their theory of government was
a very high one; but they understood perfectly
that it had to be accommodated to the shortcomings
of the average citizen. Small indeed
was their resemblance to the fiery orators and
brilliant pamphleteers of the States General.
They were emphatically good men; they were
no less emphatically practical men. They
would have scorned Mirabeau as a scoundrel;
they would have despised Sieyès as a vain and
impractical theorist.</p>

<p>The deliberations of the convention in their
result illustrated in a striking manner the truth
of the American principle, that&mdash;for deliberative,
not executive, purposes&mdash;the wisdom of
many men is worth more than the wisdom of
any one man. The Constitution that the members
assembled in convention finally produced
was not only the best possible one for America
at that time, but it was also, in spite of its
short-comings, and taking into account its fitness
for our own people and conditions, as well
as its accordance with the principles of abstract
right, probably the best that any nation has ever
had, while it was beyond question a very much
better one than any single member could have
prepared. The particularist statesmen would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
have practically denied us any real union or
efficient executive power; while there was hardly
a Federalist member who would not, in his
anxiety to avoid the evils from which we were
suffering, have given us a government so centralized
and aristocratic that it would have
been utterly unsuited to a proud, liberty-loving,
and essentially democratic race, and would have
infallibly provoked a tremendous reactionary
revolt.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read through the debates
of the convention without being struck by the
innumerable shortcomings of each individual
plan proposed by the several members, as divulged
in their speeches, when compared with
the plan finally adopted. Had the result been
in accordance with the views of the strong-government
men like Hamilton on the one hand, or
of the weak-government men like Franklin on
the other, it would have been equally disastrous
for the country. The men who afterwards
naturally became the chiefs of the Federalist
party, and who included in their number the
bulk of the great revolutionary leaders, were
the ones to whom we mainly owe our present
form of government; certainly we owe them
more, both on this and on other points, than
we do their rivals, the after-time Democrats.
Yet there were some articles of faith in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
creed of the latter so essential to our national
wellbeing, and yet so counter to the prejudices
of the Federalists, that it was inevitable they
should triumph in the end. Jefferson led the
Democrats to victory only when he had learned
to acquiesce thoroughly in some of the fundamental
principles of Federalism, and the government
of himself and his successors was good
chiefly in so far as it followed out the theories
of the Hamiltonians; while Hamilton and the
Federalists fell from power because they could
not learn the one great truth taught by Jefferson,&mdash;that
in America a statesman should
trust the people, and should endeavor to secure
to each man all possible individual liberty,
confident that he will use it aright. The old-school
Jeffersonian theorists believed in "a
strong people and a weak government." Lincoln
was the first who showed how a strong
people might have a strong government and
yet remain the freest on the earth. He seized&mdash;half
unwittingly&mdash;all that was best and
wisest in the traditions of Federalism; he was
the true successor of the Federalist leaders; but
he grafted on their system a profound belief
that the great heart of the nation beat for
truth, honor, and liberty.</p>

<p>This fact, that in 1787 all the thinkers of
the day drew out plans that in some respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
went very wide of the mark, must be kept in
mind, or else we shall judge each particular
thinker with undue harshness when we examine
his utterances without comparing them with
those of his fellows. But one partial exception
can be made. In the Constitutional Convention
Madison, a moderate Federalist, was the
man who, of all who were there, saw things
most clearly as they were, and whose theories
most closely corresponded with the principles
finally adopted; and although even he was at
first dissatisfied with the result, and both by
word and by action interpreted the Constitution
in widely different ways at different times,
still this was Madison's time of glory: he was
one of the statesmen who do extremely useful
work, but only at some single given crisis.
While the Constitution was being formed and
adopted, he stood in the very front; but in his
later career he sunk his own individuality, and
became a mere pale shadow of Jefferson.</p>

<p>Morris played a very prominent part in the
convention. He was a ready speaker, and
among all the able men present there was
probably no such really brilliant thinker. In
the debates he spoke more often than any one
else, although Madison was not far behind him;
and his speeches betrayed, but with marked
and exaggerated emphasis, both the virtues and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the shortcomings of the Federalist school of
thought. They show us, too, why he never
rose to the first rank of statesmen. His keen,
masterful mind, his far-sightedness, and the force
and subtlety of his reasoning were all marred
by his incurable cynicism and deep-rooted distrust
of mankind. He throughout appears as
<i>advocatus diaboli</i>; he puts the lowest interpretation
upon every act, and frankly avows his
disbelief in all generous and unselfish motives.
His continual allusions to the overpowering
influence of the baser passions, and to their
mastery of the human race at all times, drew
from Madison, although the two men generally
acted together, a protest against his "forever
inculcating the utter political depravity of men,
and the necessity for opposing one vice and
interest as the only possible check to another
vice and interest."</p>

<p>Morris championed a strong national government,
wherein he was right; but he also championed
a system of class representation, leaning
towards aristocracy, wherein he was wrong.
Not Hamilton himself was a firmer believer in
the national idea. His one great object was to
secure a powerful and lasting Union, instead of
a loose federal league. It must be remembered
that in the convention the term "federal" was
used in exactly the opposite sense to the one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
which it was taken afterwards; that is, it was
used as the antithesis of "national," not as its
synonym. The states-rights men used it to
express a system of government such as that of
the old federation of the thirteen colonies; while
their opponents called themselves Nationalists,
and only took the title of Federalists after the
Constitution had been formed, and then simply
because the name was popular with the masses.
They thus appropriated their adversaries' party
name, bestowing it on the organization most
hostile to their adversaries' party theories. Similarly,
the term "Republican Party," which
was originally in our history merely another
name for the Democracy, has in the end been
adopted by the chief opponents of the latter.</p>

<p>The difficulties for the convention to surmount
seemed insuperable; on almost every question
that came up, there were clashing interests.
Strong government and weak government, pure
democracy or a modified aristocracy, small states
and large states, North and South, slavery and
freedom, agricultural sections as against commercial
sections,&mdash;on each of twenty points the
delegates split into hostile camps, that could only
be reconciled by concessions from both sides.
The Constitution was not one compromise; it
was a bundle of compromises, all needful.</p>

<p>Morris, like every other member of the convention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
sometimes took the right and sometimes
the wrong side on the successive issues
that arose. But on the most important one of
all he made no error; and he commands our
entire sympathy for his thorough-going nationalism.
As was to be expected, he had no regard
whatever for states rights. He wished to
deny to the small states the equal representation
in the Senate finally allowed them; and he
was undoubtedly right theoretically. No good
argument can be adduced in support of the present
system on that point. Still, it has thus far
worked no harm; the reason being that our states
have merely artificial boundaries, while those of
small population have hitherto been distributed
pretty evenly among the different sections, so
that they have been split up like the others on
every important issue, and thus have never
been arrayed against the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Though Morris and his side were defeated in
their efforts to have the states represented proportionally
in the Senate, yet they carried their
point as to representation in the House. Also
on the general question of making a national
government, as distinguished from a league or
federation, the really vital point, their triumph
was complete. The Constitution they drew up
and had adopted no more admitted of legal or
peaceable rebellion&mdash;whether called secession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
or nullification&mdash;on the part of the state than
on the part of a county or an individual.</p>

<p>Morris expressed his own views with his
usual clear-cut, terse vigor when he asserted
that "state attachments and state importance
had been the bane of the country," and that he
came, not as a mere delegate from one section,
but "as a representative of America,&mdash;a representative
in some degree of the whole human
race, for the whole human race would be affected
by the outcome of the convention." And
he poured out the flood of his biting scorn on
those gentlemen who came there "to truck and
bargain for their respective states," asking what
man there was who could tell with certainty
the state wherein he&mdash;and even more wherein
his children&mdash;would live in the future; and
reminding the small states, with cavalier indifference,
that, "if they did not like the Union,
no matter,&mdash;they would have to come in,
and that was all there was about it; for if persuasion
did not unite the country, then the
sword would." His correct language and distinct
enunciation&mdash;to which Madison has borne
witness&mdash;allowed his grim truths to carry their
full weight; and he brought them home to his
hearers with a rough, almost startling earnestness
and directness. Many of those present
must have winced when he told them that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
would matter nothing to America "if all the
charters and constitutions of the states were
thrown into the fire, and all the demagogues
into the ocean," and asserted that "any particular
state <i>ought</i> to be injured, for the sake
of a majority of the people, in case its conduct
showed that it deserved it." He held that we
should create a national government, to be the
one and only supreme power in the land,&mdash;one
which, unlike a mere federal league, such as we
then lived under, should have complete and
compulsive operation; and he instanced the examples
as well of Greece as of Germany and the
United Netherlands, to prove that local jurisdiction
destroyed every tie of nationality.</p>

<p>It shows the boldness of the experiment in
which we were engaged, that we were forced to
take all other nations, whether dead or living,
as warnings, not examples; whereas, since we
succeeded, we have served as a pattern to be
copied, either wholly or in part, by every other
people that has followed in our steps. Before
our own experience, each similar attempt, save
perhaps on the smallest scale, had been a failure.
Where so many other nations teach by their
mistakes, we are among the few who teach by
their successes.</p>

<p>Be it noted also that, the doctrinaires to the
contrary notwithstanding, we proved that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
strong central government was perfectly compatible
with absolute democracy. Indeed, the
separatist spirit does not lead to true democratic
freedom. Anarchy is the handmaiden of
tyranny. Of all the states, South Carolina has
shown herself (at least throughout the greater
part of the present century) to be the most
aristocratic, and the most wedded to the separatist
spirit. The German masses were never
so ground down by oppression as when the little
German principalities were most independent
of each other and of any central authority.</p>

<p>Morris believed in letting the United States
interfere to put down a rebellion in a state,
even though the executive of the state himself
should be at the head of it; and he was supported
in his views by Pinckney, the ablest
member of the brilliant and useful but unfortunately
short-lived school of South Carolina
Federalists. Pinckney was a thorough-going
Nationalist; he wished to go a good deal further
than the convention actually went in giving
the central government complete control. Thus
he proposed that Congress should have power
to negative by a two-thirds vote all state laws
inconsistent with the harmony of the Union.
Madison also wished to give Congress a veto
over state legislation. Morris believed that a
national law should be allowed to repeal any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
state law, and that Congress should legislate in
all cases where the laws of the states conflicted
among themselves.</p>

<p>Yet Morris, on the very question of nationalism,
himself showed the narrowest, blindest,
and least excusable sectional jealousy on one
point. He felt as an American for all the
Union, as it then existed; but he feared and
dreaded the growth of the Union in the West,
the very place where it was inevitable, as well
as in the highest degree desirable, that the
greatest growth should take place. He actually
desired the convention to commit the criminal
folly of attempting to provide that the West
should always be kept subordinate to the East.
Fortunately he failed; but the mere attempt
casts the gravest discredit alike on his far-sightedness
and on his reputation as a statesman. It
is impossible to understand how one who was
usually so cool and clear-headed an observer
could have blundered so flagrantly on a point
hardly less vital than the establishment of the
Union itself. Indeed, had his views been carried
through, they would in the end have nullified
all the good bestowed by the Union. In speaking
against state jealousy, he had shown its
foolishness by observing that no man could tell
in what state his children would dwell; and
the folly of the speaker himself was made quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
as clear by his not perceiving that their most
likely dwelling-place was in the West. This
jealousy of the West was even more discreditable
to the Northeast than the jealousy of America
had been to England; and it continued strong,
especially in New England, for very many
years. It was a mean and unworthy feeling;
and it was greatly to the credit of the Southerners
that they shared it only to a very small
extent. The South in fact originally was in
heartiest sympathy with the West; it was not
until the middle of the present century that the
country beyond the Alleghanies became preponderatingly
Northern in sentiment. In the Constitutional
Convention itself, Butler, of South
Carolina, pointed out "that the people and
strength of America were evidently tending
westwardly and southwestwardly."</p>

<p>Morris wished to discriminate against the
West by securing to the Atlantic States the perpetual
control of the Union. He brought this
idea up again and again, insisting that we should
reserve to ourselves the right to put conditions
on the Western States when we should admit
them. He dwelt at length on the danger of
throwing the preponderance of influence into the
Western scale; stating his dread of the "back
members," who were always the most ignorant,
and the opponents of all good measures. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
foretold with fear that some day the people of
the West would outnumber the people of the
East, and he wished to put it in the power of
the latter to keep a majority of the votes in
their own hands. Apparently he did not see
that, if the West once became as populous as
he predicted, its legislators would forthwith
cease to be "back members." The futility of
his fears, and still more of his remedies, was so
evident that the convention paid very little heed
to either.</p>

<p>On one point, however, his anticipations of
harm were reasonable, and indeed afterwards
came true in part. He insisted that the West,
or interior, would join the South and force us
into a war with some European power, wherein
the benefits would accrue to them and the harm
to the Northeast. The attitude of the South
and West already clearly foreshadowed a struggle
with Spain for the Mississippi Valley; and
such a struggle would surely have come, either
with the French or Spaniards, had we failed to
secure the territory in question by peaceful
purchase. As it was, the realization of Morris's
prophecy was only put off for a few years; the
South and West brought on the War of 1812,
wherein the East was the chief sufferer.</p>

<p>On the question as to whether the Constitution
should be made absolutely democratic or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
not, Morris took the conservative side. On the
suffrage his views are perfectly defensible: he
believed that it should be limited to freeholders.
He rightly considered the question as to how
widely it should be extended to be one of expediency
merely. It is simply idle folly to talk
of suffrage as being an "inborn" or "natural"
right. There are enormous communities totally
unfit for its exercise; while true universal
suffrage never has been, and never will be,
seriously advocated by any one. There must
always be an age limit, and such a limit must
necessarily be purely arbitrary. The wildest
democrat of revolutionary times did not dream
of doing away with the restrictions of race and
sex which kept most American citizens from
the ballot-box; and there is certainly much less
abstract right in a system which limits the
suffrage to people of a certain color than there
is in one which limits it to people who come up
to a given standard of thrift and intelligence.
On the other hand, our experience has not
proved that men of wealth make any better use
of their ballots than do, for instance, mechanics
and other handicraftsmen. No plan could be
adopted so perfect as to be free from all drawbacks.
On the whole, however, and taking our
country in its length and breadth, manhood
suffrage has worked well, better than would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
have been the case with any other system; but
even here there are certain localities where its
results have been evil, and must simply be accepted
as the blemishes inevitably attendant
upon, and marring, any effort to carry out a
scheme that will be widely applicable.</p>

<p>Morris contended that his plan would work
no novel or great hardship, as the people in
several states were already accustomed to freehold
suffrage. He considered the freeholders
to be the best guardians of liberty, and maintained
that the restriction of the right to
them was only creating a necessary safeguard
"against the dangerous influence of those
people without property or principle, with
whom, in the end, our country, like all other
countries, was sure to abound." He did not
believe that the ignorant and dependent could
be trusted to vote. Madison supported him
heartily, likewise thinking the freeholders the
safest guardians of our rights; he indulged
in some gloomy (and fortunately hitherto unverified)
forebodings as to our future, which
sound strangely coming from one who was
afterwards an especial pet of the Jeffersonian
democracy. He said: "In future times a
great majority of the people will be without
landed or any other property. They will then
either combine under the influence of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
common situation,&mdash;in which case the rights
of property and the public liberty will not be
safe in their hands,&mdash;or, as is more probable,
they will become the tools of opulence and ambition."</p>

<p>Morris also enlarged on this last idea. "Give
the votes to people who have no property,
and they will sell them to the rich," said he.
When taunted with his aristocratic tendencies,
he answered that he had long ceased to be the
dupe of words, that the mere sound of the name
"aristocracy" had no terrors for him, but that
he did fear lest harm should result to the people
from the unacknowledged existence of the very
thing they feared to mention. As he put it,
there never was or would be a civilized society
without an aristocracy, and his endeavor was
to keep it as much as possible from doing mischief.
He thus professed to be opposed to the
existence of an aristocracy, but convinced that
it would exist anyhow, and that therefore the
best thing to be done was to give it a recognized
place, while clipping its wings so as to
prevent its working harm. In pursuance of
this theory, he elaborated a wild plan, the chief
feature of which was the provision for an aristocratic
senate, and a popular or democratic
house, which were to hold each other in check,
and thereby prevent either party from doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
damage. He believed that the senators should
be appointed by the national executive, who
should fill up the vacancies that occurred. To
make the upper house effective as a checking
branch, it should be so constituted to as have a
personal interest in checking the other branch;
it should be a senate for life, it should be rich,
it should be aristocratic. He continued:&mdash;It
would then do wrong? He believed so; he
hoped so. The rich would strive to enslave the
rest; they always did. The proper security
against them was to form them into a separate
interest. The two forces would then control
each other. By thus combining and setting
apart the aristocratic interest, the popular interest
would also be combined against it.
There would be mutual check and mutual
security. If, on the contrary, the rich and
poor were allowed to mingle, then, if the country
were commercial, an oligarchy would be
established; and if it were not, an unlimited
democracy would ensue. It was best to look
truth in the face. The loaves and fishes would
be needed to bribe demagogues; while as for
the people, if left to themselves, they would
never act from reason alone. The rich would
take advantage of their passions, and the result
would be either a violent aristocracy, or a more
violent despotism.&mdash;The speech containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
these extraordinary sentiments, which do no
particular credit to either Morris's head or
heart, is given in substance by Madison in the
"Debates." Madison's report is undoubtedly
correct, for, after writing it, he showed it to the
speaker himself, who made but one or two verbal
alterations.</p>

<p>Morris applied an old theory in a new way
when he proposed to make "taxation proportional
to representation" throughout the Union.
He considered the preservation of property as
being the distinguishing object of civilization,
as liberty was sufficiently guaranteed even by
savagery; and therefore he held that the representation
in the senate should be according to
property as well as numbers. But when this
proposition was defeated, he declined to support
one making property qualifications for
congressmen, remarking that such were proper
for the electors rather than the elected.</p>

<p>His views as to the power and functions of
the national executive were in the main sound,
and he succeeded in having most of them embodied
in the Constitution. He wished to
have the President hold office during good behavior;
and, though this was negatived, he
succeeded in having him made reëligible to
the position. He was instrumental in giving
him a qualified veto over legislation, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
providing for his impeachment for misconduct;
and also in having him made commander-in-chief
of the forces of the republic, and in
allowing him the appointment of governmental
officers. The especial service he rendered,
however, was his successful opposition to the
plan whereby the President was to be elected
by the legislature. This proposition he combated
with all his strength, showing that it
would take away greatly from the dignity of
the executive, and would render his election a
matter of cabal and faction, "like the election
of the pope by a conclave of cardinals." He
contended that the President should be chosen
by the people at large, by the citizens of the
United States, acting through electors whom
they had picked out. He showed the probability
that in such a case the people would unite
upon a man of continental reputation, as the
influence of designing demagogues and tricksters
is generally powerful in proportion as the limits
within which they work are narrow; and the
importance of the stake would make all men
inform themselves thoroughly as to the characters
and capacities of those who were contending
for it; and he flatly denied the statements,
that were made in evident good faith, to
the effect that in a general election each State
would cast its vote for its own favorite citizen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
He inclined to regard the President in the light
of a tribune chosen by the people to watch
over the legislature; and giving him the appointing
power, he believed, would force him
to make good use of it, owing to his sense of
responsibility to the people at large, who would
be directly affected by its exercise, and who
could and would hold him accountable for its
abuse.</p>

<p>On the judiciary his views were also sound.
He upheld the power of the judges, and maintained
that they should have absolute decision
as to the constitutionality of any law. By
this means he hoped to provide against the
encroachments of the popular branch of the
government, the one from which danger was
to be feared, as "virtuous citizens will often
act as legislators in a way of which they would,
as private individuals, afterwards be ashamed."
He wisely disapproved of low salaries for the
judges, showing that the amounts must be fixed
from time to time in accordance with the
manner and style of living in the country; and
that good work on the bench, where it was
especially needful, like good work everywhere
else, could only be insured by a high rate of
recompense. On the other hand, he approved
of introducing into the national Constitution
the foolish New York state inventions of a
Council of Revision and an Executive Council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
His ideas of the duties and powers of Congress
were likewise very proper on the whole.
Most citizens of the present day will agree
with him that "the excess rather than the
deficiency of laws is what we have to dread."
He opposed the hurtful provision which requires
that each congressman should be a
resident of his own district, urging that congressmen
represented the people at large, as
well as their own small localities; and he also
objected to making officers of the army and
navy ineligible. He laid much stress on the
propriety of passing navigation acts to encourage
American bottoms and seamen, as a navy
was essential to our security, and the shipping
business was always one that stood in peculiar
need of public patronage. Also, like Hamilton
and most other Federalists, he favored a policy
of encouraging domestic manufactures. Incidentally
he approved of Congress having the
power to lay an embargo, although he has elsewhere
recorded his views as to the general
futility of such kinds of "commercial warfare."
He believed in having a uniform bankruptcy
law; approved of abolishing all religious tests
as qualifications for office, and was utterly opposed
to the "rotation in office" theory.</p>

<p>One curious incident in the convention was
the sudden outcropping, even thus early, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
"Native American" movement against all foreigners,
which was headed by Butler, of South
Carolina, who himself was of Irish parentage.
He strenuously insisted that no foreigners
whomsoever should be admitted to our councils,&mdash;a
rather odd proposition, considering that it
would have excluded quite a number of the
eminent men he was then addressing. Pennsylvania
in particular&mdash;whose array of native
talent has always been far from imposing&mdash;had
a number of foreigners among her delegates,
and loudly opposed the proposition, as did New
York. These States wished that there should
be no discrimination whatever between native
and foreign born citizens; but finally a compromise
was agreed to, by which the latter
were excluded only from the Presidency, but
were admitted to all other rights after a seven
years' residence,&mdash;a period that was certainly
none too long.</p>

<p>A much more serious struggle took place
over the matter of slavery, quite as important
then as ever, for at that time the negroes were
a fifth of our population, instead of, as now,
an eighth. The question, as it came before
the convention, had several sides to it; the
especial difficulty arising over the representation
of the Slave States in Congress, and the
importation of additional slaves from Africa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
No one proposed to abolish slavery off-hand;
but an influential though small number of
delegates, headed by Morris, recognized it as
a terrible evil, and were very loath either to
allow the South additional representation for
the slaves, or to permit the foreign trade in
them to go on. When the Southern members
banded together on the issue, and made it evident
that it was the one which they regarded
as almost the most important of all, Morris attacked
them in a telling speech, stating with
his usual boldness facts that most Northerners
only dared hint at, and summing up with the
remark that, if he was driven to the dilemma
of doing injustice to the Southern States or to
human nature, he would have to do it to the
former; certainly he would not encourage the
slave trade by allowing representation for
negroes. Afterwards he characterized the proportional
representation of the blacks even
more strongly, as being "a bribe for the importation
of slaves."</p>

<p>In advocating the proposal, first made by
Hamilton, that the representation should in all
cases be proportioned to the number of free
inhabitants, Morris showed the utter lack of
logic in the Virginian proposition, which was
that the Slave States should have additional
representation to the extent of three fifths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
their negroes. If negroes were to be considered
as inhabitants, then they ought to be added in
their entire number; if they were to be considered
as property, then they ought to be counted
only if all other wealth was likewise included.
The position of the Southerners was ridiculous:
he tore their arguments to shreds; but he was
powerless to alter the fact that they were
doggedly determined to carry their point, while
most of the Northern members cared comparatively
little about it.</p>

<p>In another speech he painted in the blackest
colors the unspeakable misery and wrong
wrought by slavery, and showed the blight it
brought upon the land. "It was the curse of
Heaven on the states where it prevailed." He
contrasted the prosperity and happiness of the
Northern States with the misery and poverty
which overspread the barren wastes of those
where slaves were numerous. "Every step you
take through the great region of slavery presents
a desert widening with the increasing
number of these wretched beings." He indignantly
protested against the Northern States
being bound to march their militia for the
defense of the Southern States against the
very slaves of whose existence the northern men
complained. "He would sooner submit himself
to a tax for paying for all the negroes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
United States than saddle posterity with such
a Constitution."</p>

<p>Some of the high-minded Virginian statesmen
were quite as vigorous as he was in their
denunciation of the system. One of them,
George Mason, portrayed the effect of slavery
upon the people at large with bitter emphasis,
and denounced the slave traffic as "infernal,"
and slavery as a national sin that would be
punished by a national calamity,&mdash;stating therein
the exact and terrible truth. In shameful contrast,
many of the Northerners championed the
institution; in particular, Oliver Ellsworth, of
Connecticut, whose name should be branded with
infamy because of the words he then uttered.
He actually advocated the free importation of
negroes into the South Atlantic States, because
the slaves "died so fast in the sickly rice
swamps" that it was necessary ever to bring
fresh ones to labor and perish in the places of
their predecessors; and, with a brutal cynicism,
peculiarly revolting from its mercantile baseness,
he brushed aside the question of morality
as irrelevant, asking his hearers to pay heed
only to the fact that "what enriches the part
enriches the whole."</p>

<p>The Virginians were opposed to the slave
trade: but South Carolina and Georgia made
it a condition of their coming into the Union.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
It was accordingly agreed that it should be
allowed for a limited time,&mdash;twelve years;
and this was afterwards extended to twenty by
a bargain made by Maryland and the three
South Atlantic States with the New England
States, the latter getting in return the help of
the former to alter certain provisions respecting
commerce. One of the main industries of
the New England of that day was the manufacture
of rum; and its citizens cared more for
their distilleries than for all the slaves held in
bondage throughout Christendom. The rum
was made from molasses which they imported
from the West Indies, and they carried there in
return the fish taken by their great fishing
fleets; they also carried the slaves into the
Southern ports. Their commerce was what
they especially relied on; and to gain support
for it they were perfectly willing to make
terms with even such a black Mammon of unrighteousness
as the Southern slaveholding system.
Throughout the contest, Morris and a
few other stout anti-slavery men are the only
ones who appear to advantage; the Virginians,
who were honorably anxious to minimize the
evils of slavery, come next; then the other
Southerners who allowed pressing self-interest
to overcome their scruples; and, last of all, the
New Englanders whom a comparatively trivial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
self-interest made the willing allies of the extreme
slaveholders. These last were the only
Northerners who yielded anything to the Southern
slaveholders that was not absolutely necessary;
and yet they were the forefathers of the
most determined and effective foes that slavery
ever had.</p>

<p>As already said, the Southerners stood firm
on the slave question: it was the one which
perhaps more than any other offered the most
serious obstacle to a settlement. Madison
pointed out "that the real difference lay, not
between the small States and the large, but
between the Northern and the Southern States.
The institution of slavery and its consequences
formed the real line of discrimination." To
talk of this kind Morris at first answered hotly
enough:&mdash;"he saw that the Southern gentlemen
would not be satisfied unless they saw the
way open to their gaining a majority in the public
councils.... If [the distinction they set up
between the North and South] was real, instead
of attempting to blend incompatible things, let
them at once take a friendly leave of each
other." He afterwards went back from this
position, and agreed to the compromise by
which the slaves were to add, by three fifths of
their number, to the representation of their
masters, and the slave trade was to be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
for a certain number of years, and prohibited
forever after. He showed his usual straightforward
willingness to call things by their right
names in desiring to see "slavery" named
outright in the Constitution, instead of being
characterized with cowardly circumlocution, as
was actually done.</p>

<p>In finally yielding and assenting to a compromise,
he was perfectly right. The crazy
talk about the iniquity of consenting to any
recognition of slavery whatever in the Constitution
is quite beside the mark; and it is
equally irrelevant to assert that the so-called
"compromises" were not properly compromises
at all, because there were no mutual concessions,
and the Southern States had "no shadow
of right" to what they demanded and only in
part gave up. It was all-important that there
should be a Union, but it had to result from
the voluntary action of all the states; and each
state had a perfect "right" to demand just
whatever it chose. The really wise and high-minded
statesmen demanded for themselves
nothing save justice; but they had to accomplish
their purpose by yielding somewhat to the
prejudices of their more foolish and less disinterested
colleagues. It was better to limit the
duration of the slave trade to twenty years than
to allow it to be continued indefinitely, as would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
have been the case had the South Atlantic
States remained by themselves. The three
fifths representation of the slaves was an evil
anomaly, but it was no worse than allowing
the small states equal representation in the
Senate; indeed, balancing the two concessions
against each other, it must be admitted that
Virginia and North Carolina surrendered to
New Hampshire and Rhode Island more than
they got in return.</p>

<p>No man who supported slavery can ever have
a clear and flawless title to our regard; and
those who opposed it merit, in so far, the
highest honor; but the opposition to it sometimes
took forms that can be considered only
as the vagaries of lunacy. The only hope of
abolishing it lay, first in the establishment
and then in the preservation of the Union;
and if we had at the outset dissolved into a
knot of struggling anarchies, it would have
entailed an amount of evil both on our race
and on all North America, compared to which
the endurance of slavery for a century or two
would have been as nothing. If we had even
split up into only two republics, a Northern
and a Southern, the West would probably have
gone with the latter, and to this day slavery
would have existed throughout the Mississippi
valley; much of what is now our territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
would have been held by European powers,
scornfully heedless of our divided might, while
in not a few states the form of government
would have been a military dictatorship; and
indeed our whole history would have been as
contemptible as was that of Germany for some
centuries prior to the rise of the house of Hohenzollern.</p>

<p>The fierceness of the opposition to the adoption
of the Constitution, and the narrowness
of the majority by which Virginia and New
York decided in its favor, while North Carolina
and Rhode Island did not come in at all until
absolutely forced, showed that the refusal to
compromise on any one of the points at issue
would have jeopardized everything. Had the
slavery interest been in the least dissatisfied, or
had the plan of government been a shade less
democratic, or had the smaller States not been
propitiated, the Constitution would have been
rejected off-hand; and the country would have
had before it decades, perhaps centuries, of
misrule, violence, and disorder.</p>

<p>Madison paid a very just compliment to some
of Morris's best points when he wrote, anent
his services in the convention: "To the brilliancy
of his genius he added, what is too rare,
a candid surrender of his opinions when the
light of discussion satisfied him that they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
been too hastily formed, and a readiness to aid
in making the best of measures in which he
had been overruled." Although so many of
his own theories had been rejected, he was one
of the warmest advocates of the Constitution;
and it was he who finally drew up the document
and put the finish to its style and arrangement,
so that, as it now stands, it comes from
his pen.</p>

<p>Hamilton, who more than any other man
bore the brunt of the fight for its adoption,
asked Morris to help him in writing the
"Federalist," but the latter was for some reason
unable to do so; and Hamilton was assisted
only by Madison, and to a very slight extent
by Jay. Pennsylvania, the State from which
Morris had been sent as a delegate, early declared
in favor of the new experiment; although,
as Morris wrote Washington, there had been
cause to "dread the cold and sour temper of
the back counties, and still more the wicked
industry of those who have long habituated
themselves to live on the public, and cannot
bear the idea of being removed from the power
and profit of state government, which has
been and still is the means of supporting themselves,
their families, and dependents, and (which
perhaps is equally grateful) of depressing and
humbling their political adversaries." In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
own native state of New York the influences
he thus describes were still more powerful, and
it needed all Hamilton's wonderful genius to
force a ratification of the Constitution in spite
of the stupid selfishness of the Clintonian
faction; as it was, he was only barely successful,
although backed by all the best and ablest
leaders in the community,&mdash;Jay, Livingstone,
Schuyler, Stephen Van Rensselaer, Isaac
Roosevelt, James Duane, and a host of others.</p>

<p>About this time Morris came back to New
York to live, having purchased the family
estate at Morrisania from his elder brother,
Staats Long Morris, the British general. He
had for some time been engaged in various
successful commercial ventures with his friend
Robert Morris, including an East India voyage
on a large scale, shipments of tobacco to
France, and a share in iron works on the Delaware
River, and had become quite a rich man.
As soon as the war was ended, he had done
what he could do to have the loyalists pardoned
and reinstated in their fortunes; thereby risking
his popularity not a little, as the general
feeling against the Tories was bitter and malevolent
in the highest degree, in curious contrast
to the good-will that so rapidly sprang up
between the Unionists and ex-Confederates after
the Civil War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
He also kept an eye on foreign politics, and
one of his letters to Jay curiously foreshadows
the good-will generally felt by Americans of
the present day towards Russia, running: "If
her ladyship (the Czarina) would drive the
Turk out of Europe, and demolish the Algerines
and other piratical gentry, she will have done
us much good for her own sake; ... but it is
hardly possible the other powers will permit
Russia to possess so wide a door into the Mediterranean.
I may be deceived, but I think
England herself would oppose it. As an American,
it is my hearty wish that she may effect
her schemes."</p>

<p>Shortly after this it became necessary for
him to sail for Europe on business.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>FIRST STAY IN FRANCE.</h3>

<p>After a hard winter passage of forty days'
length Morris reached France, and arrived in
Paris on February 3, 1789. He remained there
a year on his private business; but his prominence
in America, and his intimate friendship
with many distinguished Frenchmen, at
once admitted him to the highest social and
political circles, where his brilliant talents secured
him immediate importance.</p>

<p>The next nine years of his life were spent in
Europe, and it was during this time that he unknowingly
rendered his especial and peculiar
service to the public. As an American statesman
he has many rivals, and not a few superiors;
but as a penetrating observer and recorder
of contemporary events, he stands alone
among the men of his time. He kept a full
diary during his stay abroad, and was a most
voluminous correspondent; and his capacity
for keen, shrewd observation, his truthfulness,
his wonderful insight into character, his sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of humor, and his power of graphic description,
all combine to make his comments on the
chief men and events of the day a unique
record of the inside history of Western Europe
during the tremendous convulsions of the
French Revolution. He is always an entertaining
and in all matters of fact a trustworthy
writer. His letters and diary together
form a real mine of wealth for the student
either of the social life of the upper classes in
France just before the outbreak, or of the
events of the Revolution itself.</p>

<p>In the first place, it must be premised that
from the outset Morris was hostile to the spirit
of the French Revolution, and his hostility grew
in proportion to its excesses until at last it
completely swallowed up his original antipathy
to England, and made him regard France
as normally our enemy, not our ally. This was
perfectly natural, and indeed inevitable: in
all really free countries, the best friends of
freedom regarded the revolutionists, when they
had fairly begun their bloody career, with
horror and anger. It was only to oppressed,
debased, and priest-ridden peoples that the
French Revolution could come as the embodiment
of liberty. Compared to the freedom already
enjoyed by Americans, it was sheer
tyranny of the most dreadful kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Morris saw clearly that the popular party in
France, composed in part of amiable visionaries,
theoretic philanthropists, and closet
constitution-mongers, and in part of a brutal,
sodden populace, maddened by the grinding
wrongs of ages, knew not whither its own steps
tended; and he also saw that the then existing
generation of Frenchmen were not, and never
would be, fitted to use liberty aright. It is
small matter for wonder that he could not see
as clearly the good which lay behind the
movement; that he could not as readily foretell
the real and great improvement it was
finally to bring about, though only after a generation
of hideous convulsions. Even as it was,
he discerned what was happening, and what
was about to happen, more distinctly than did
any one else. The wild friends of the French
Revolution, especially in America, supported it
blindly, with but a very slight notion of what
it really signified. Keen though Morris's intellectual
vision was, it was impossible for him
to see what future lay beyond the quarter of a
century of impending tumult. It did not lie
within his powers to applaud the fiendish atrocities
of the Red Terror for the sake of the problematical
good that would come to the next
generation. To do so he would have needed
the granite heart of a zealot, as well as the prophetic
vision of a seer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>The French Revolution was in its essence
a struggle for the abolition of privilege, and
for equality in civil rights. This Morris perceived,
almost alone among the statesmen of
his day; and he also perceived that most
Frenchmen were willing to submit to any kind
of government that would secure them the
things for which they strove. As he wrote to
Jefferson, when the republic was well under
weigh: "The great mass of the French nation
is less solicitous to preserve the present order of
things than to prevent the return of the ancient
oppression, and of course would more readily
submit to a pure despotism than to that kind
of monarchy whose only limits were found in
those noble, legal and clerical corps by which
the people were alternately oppressed and insulted."
To the down-trodden masses of continental
Europe the gift of civil rights and
the removal of the tyranny of the privileged
classes, even though accompanied by the rule
of a directory, a consul, or an emperor, represented
an immense political advance; but
to the free people of England, and to the freer
people of America, the change would have
been wholly for the worse.</p>

<p>Such being the case, Morris's attitude was
natural and proper. There is no reason to
question the sincerity of his statement in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
letter, that "I do, from the bottom of my
heart, wish well to this country [France]."
Had the French people shown the least moderation
or wisdom, he would have unhesitatingly
sided with them against their oppressors.
It must be kept in mind that he was not influenced
in the least in his course by the views
of the upper classes with whom he mingled. On
the contrary, when he first came to Europe, he
distinctly lost popularity in some of the social
circles in which he moved, because he was so
much more conservative than his aristocratic
friends, among whom the closet republicanism
of the philosophers was for the moment
all the rage. He had no love for the French
nobility, whose folly and ferocity caused the
Revolution, and whose craven cowardice could
not check it even before it had gathered headway.
Long afterwards he wrote of some of the
<i>emigrés</i>: "The conversation of these gentlemen,
who have the virtue and good fortune of
their grandfathers to recommend them, leads
me almost to forget the crimes of the French
Revolution; and often the unforgiving temper
and sanguinary wishes which they exhibit
make me almost believe that the assertion of
their enemies is true, namely, that it is success
alone which has determined on whose side
should be the crimes, and on whose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
miseries." The truth of the last sentence was
strikingly verified by the White Terror, even
meaner, if less bloody, than the Red. Bourbon
princes and Bourbon nobles were alike, and
Morris only erred in not seeing that their destruction
was the condition precedent upon all
progress.</p>

<p>There was never another great struggle, in
the end productive of good to mankind, where
the tools and methods by which that end was
won were so wholly vile as in the French
Revolution. Alone among movements of the
kind, it brought forth no leaders entitled to our
respect; none who were both great and good;
none even who were very great, save, at its
beginning, strange, strong, crooked Mirabeau,
and at its close the towering world-genius who
sprang to power by its means, wielded it for his
own selfish purposes, and dazzled all nations
over the wide earth by the glory of his strength
and splendor.</p>

<p>We can hardly blame Morris for not appreciating
a revolution whose immediate outcome
was to be Napoleon's despotism, even though
he failed to see all the good that would remotely
spring therefrom. He considered, as he once
wrote a friend, that "the true object of a great
statesman is to give to any particular nation
the kind of laws which is suitable to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and the best constitution which they are capable
of." There can be no sounder rule of statesmanship;
and none was more flagrantly broken
by the amiable but incompetent political doctrinaires
of 1789. Thus the American, as a
far-sighted statesman, despised the theorists
who began the Revolution, and, as a humane
and honorable man, abhorred the black-hearted
wretches who carried it on. His view of the
people among whom he found himself, as well
as his statement of his own position, he himself
has recorded: "To fit people for a republic,
as for any other form of government, a previous
education is necessary.... In despotic
governments the people, habituated to beholding
everything bending beneath the weight of
power, never possess that power for a moment
without abusing it. Slaves, driven to despair,
take arms, execute vast vengeance, and then
sink back to their former condition of slaves.
In such societies the patriot, the melancholy
patriot, sides with the despot, because anything
is better than a wild and bloody confusion."</p>

<p>So much for an outline of his views. His
writings preserve them for us in detail on almost
every important question that came up
during his stay in Europe; couched, moreover,
in telling, piquant sentences that leave room
for hardly a dull line in either letters or diary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
No sooner had he arrived in Paris than he
sought out Jefferson, then the American minister,
and Lafayette. They engaged him to dine
on the two following nights. He presented his
various letters of introduction, and in a very
few weeks, by his wit, tact, and ability, had
made himself completely at home in what was
by far the most brilliant and attractive&mdash;although
also the most hopelessly unsound&mdash;fashionable
society of any European capital.
He got on equally well with fine ladies, philosophers,
and statesmen; was as much at his
ease in the salons of the one as at the dinner-tables
of the other; and all the time observed
and noted down, with the same humorous zest,
the social peculiarities of his new friends as
well as the tremendous march of political
events. Indeed, it is difficult to know whether
to set the higher value on his penetrating observations
concerning public affairs, or on his
witty, light, half-satirical sketches of the men
and women of the world with whom he was
thrown in contact, told in his usual charming
and effective style. No other American of
note has left us writings half so humorous and
amusing, filled, too, with information of the
greatest value.</p>

<p>Although his relations with Jefferson were
at this time very friendly, yet his ideas on most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
subjects were completely at variance with those
of the latter. He visited him very often; and,
after one of these occasions, jots down his opinion
of his friend in his usual amusing vein:
"Call on Mr. Jefferson, and sit a good while.
General conversation on character and politics.
I think he does not form very just estimates of
character, but rather assigns too many to the
humble rank of fools; whereas in life the
gradations are infinite, and each individual has
his peculiarities of fort and feeble:" Not a
bad protest against the dangers of sweeping
generalization. Another time he records his
judgment of Jefferson's ideas on public matters
as follows: "He and I differ in our systems of
politics. He, with all the leaders of liberty
here, is desirous of annihilating distinctions
of order. How far such views may be right
respecting mankind in general is, I think, extremely
problematical. But with respect to
this nation I am sure they are wrong, and cannot
eventuate well."</p>

<p>As soon as he began to go out in Parisian
society, he was struck by the closet republicanism
which it had become the fashion to
affect. After his first visit to Lafayette, who
received him with that warmth and frank, open-handed
hospitality which he always extended to
Americans, Morris writes: "Lafayette is full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of politics; he appears to be too republican for
the genius of his country." And again, when
Lafayette showed him the draft of the celebrated
Declaration of Rights, he notes: "I
gave him my opinions, and suggested several
amendments tending to soften the high-colored
expressions of freedom. It is not by sounding
words that revolutions are produced." Elsewhere
he writes that "the young nobility have
brought themselves to an active faith in the
natural equality of mankind, and spurn at
everything which looks like restraint." Some
of their number, however, he considered to be
actuated by considerations more tangible than
mere sentiment. He chronicles a dinner with
some members of the National Assembly,
where "one, a noble representing the <i>Tiers</i>, is
so vociferous against his own order, that I am
convinced he means to rise by his eloquence,
and finally will, I expect, vote with the opinion
of the court, let that be what it may." The
sentimental humanitarians&mdash;who always form
a most pernicious body, with an influence for
bad hardly surpassed by that of the professionally
criminal class&mdash;of course throve vigorously
in an atmosphere where theories of mawkish
benevolence went hand in hand with the
habitual practice of vices too gross to name.
Morris, in one of his letters, narrates an instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
in point; at the same time showing
how this excess of watery philanthropy was,
like all the other movements of the French
Revolution, but a violent and misguided reaction
against former abuses of the opposite sort.
The incident took place in Madame de Staël's
salon. "The Count de Clermont Tonnerre, one
of their best orators, read to us a very pathetic
oration; and the object was to show that no
penalties are the legal compensations for crimes
or injuries: the man who is hanged, having
by that event paid his debt to society, ought
not to be held in dishonor; and in like manner
he who has been condemned for seven years to
be flogged in the galleys, should, when he has
served out his apprenticeship, be received again
into good company, as if nothing had happened.
You smile; but observe the extreme to which
the matter was carried the other way. Dishonoring
thousands for the guilt of one has so
shocked the public sentiment as to render this
extreme fashionable. The oration was very
fine, very sentimental, very pathetic, and the
style harmonious. Shouts of applause and full
approbation. When this was pretty well over,
I told him that his speech was extremely eloquent,
but that his principles were not very
solid. Universal surprise!"</p>

<p>At times he became rather weary of the constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
discussion of politics, which had become
the chief drawing-room topic. Among the capacities
of his lively and erratic nature was the
power of being intensely bored by anything
dull or monotonous. He remarked testily that
"republicanism was absolutely a moral influenza,
from which neither titles, places, nor even
the diadem can guard the possessor." In a letter
to a friend on a different subject he writes:
"Apropos,&mdash;a term which my Lord Chesterfield
well observes we generally use to bring
in what is not at all to the purpose,&mdash;apropos,
then, I have here the strangest employment
imaginable. A republican, and just as it were
emerged from that assembly which has formed
one of the most republican of all republican
constitutions, I preach incessantly respect for
the prince, attention to the rights of the
nobles, and above all moderation, not only in
the object, but also in the pursuit of it. All
this you will say is none of my business; but I
consider France as the natural ally of my country,
and, of course, that we are interested in her
prosperity; besides, to say the truth, I love
France."</p>

<p>His hostility to the fashionable cult offended
some of his best friends. The Lafayettes
openly disapproved his sentiments. The
Marquis told him that he was injuring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
cause, because his sentiments were being continually
quoted against "the good party."
Morris answered that he was opposed to
democracy from a regard to liberty; that the
popular party were going straight to destruction,
and he would fain stop them if he could;
for their views respecting the nation were totally
inconsistent with the materials of which
it was composed, and the worst thing that
could happen to them would be to have their
wishes granted. Lafayette half admitted
that this was true: "He tells me that he is
sensible his party are mad, and tells them so,
but is not the less determined to die with them.
I tell him that I think it would be quite as well
to bring them to their senses and live with
them,"&mdash;the last sentence showing the impatience
with which the shrewd, fearless, practical
American at times regarded the dreamy
inefficiency of his French associates. Madame
de Lafayette was even more hostile than her husband
to Morris's ideas. In commenting on her
beliefs he says: "She is a very sensible woman,
but has formed her ideas of government in a
manner not suited, I think, either to the situation,
the circumstances, or the disposition of
France."</p>

<p>He was considered too much of an aristocrat
in the salon of the Comtesse de Tessé, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
resort of "republicans of the first feather;"
and at first was sometimes rather coldly received
there. He felt, however, a most sincere
friendship and regard for the comtesse, and
thoroughly respected the earnestness with
which she had for twenty years done what lay
in her power to give her country greater
liberty. She was a genuine enthusiast, and,
when the National Assembly met, was filled
with exultant hope for the future. The ferocious
outbreaks of the mob, and the crazy lust
for blood shown by the people at large, startled
her out of her faith, and shocked her into the
sad belief that her life-long and painful labors
had been wasted in the aid of a bad cause.
Later in the year Morris writes: "I find
Madame de Tessé is become a convert to my
principles. We have a gay conversation of some
minutes on their affairs, in which I mingle
sound maxims of government with that piquant
<i>légèreté</i> which this nation delights in. She
insists that I dine with her at Versailles the
next time I am there. We are vastly gracious,
and all at once, in a serious tone, 'Mais attendez,
madame, est-ce que je suis trop aristocrat?'
To which she answers, with a smile of
gentle humility, 'Oh, mon Dieu, non!'"</p>

<p>It is curious to notice how rapidly Morris's
brilliant talents gave him a commanding position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
stranger and guest though he was, among
the most noted statesmen of France; how
often he was consulted, and how widely his
opinions were quoted. Moreover, his incisive
truthfulness makes his writings more valuable
to the historian of his time than are those of
any of his contemporaries, French, English, or
American. Taine, in his great work on the
Revolution, ranks him high among the small
number of observers who have recorded clear
and sound judgments of those years of confused,
formless tumult and horror.</p>

<p>All his views on French politics are very
striking. As soon as he reached Paris, he was
impressed by the unrest and desire for change
prevailing everywhere, and wrote home: "I
find on this side of the Atlantic a resemblance
to what I left on the other,&mdash;a nation
which exists in hopes, prospects, and expectations;
the reverence for ancient establishments
gone; existing forms shaken to the very
foundation; and a new order of things about to
take place, in which, perhaps, even the very
names of all former institutions will be disregarded."
And again: "This country presents
an astonishing spectacle to one who has collected
his ideas from books and information half
a dozen years old. Everything is <i>à l'Anglaise</i>,
and a desire to imitate the English prevails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
alike in the cut of a coat and the form of a
constitution. Like the English, too, all are
engaged in parliamenteering; and when we
consider how novel this last business must be,
I assure you the progress is far from contemptible,"&mdash;a
reference to Lafayette's electioneering
trip to Auvergne. The rapidity with
which, in America, order had come out of chaos,
while in France the reverse process had been
going on, impressed him deeply; as he says:
"If any new lesson were wanting to impress
on our hearts a deep sense of the mutability
of human affairs, the double contrast between
France and America two years ago and at the
present would surely furnish it."</p>

<p>He saw at once that the revolutionists had
it in their power to do about as they chose.
"If there be any real vigor in the nation the
prevailing party in the States-General may, if
they please, overturn the monarchy itself,
should the king commit his authority to a
contest with them. The court is extremely
feeble, and the manners are so extremely corrupt
that they cannot succeed if there be any
consistent opposition, unless the whole nation
be equally depraved."</p>

<p>He did not believe that the people would be
able to profit by the revolution, or to use their
opportunities aright. For the numerous class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of patriots who felt a vague, though fervent,
enthusiasm for liberty in the abstract, and who,
without the slightest practical knowledge, were
yet intent on having all their own pet theories
put into practice, he felt profound scorn and
contempt; while he distrusted and despised the
mass of Frenchmen, because of their frivolity
and viciousness. He knew well that a pure
theorist may often do as much damage to a
country as the most corrupt traitor; and very
properly considered that in politics the fool is
quite as obnoxious as the knave. He also
realized that levity and the inability to look
life seriously in the face, or to attend to the
things worth doing, may render a man just as
incompetent to fulfil the duties of citizenship
as would actual viciousness.</p>

<p>To the crazy theories of the constitution-makers
and closet-republicans generally, he
often alludes in his diary, and in his letters
home. In one place he notes: "The literary
people here, observing the abuses of the monarchical
form, imagine that everything must go
the better in proportion as it recedes from the
present establishment, and in their closets they
make men exactly suited to their systems; but
unluckily they are such men as exist nowhere
else, and least of all in France." And he writes
almost the same thing to Washington: "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
middle party, who mean well, have unfortunately
acquired their ideas of government from
books, and are admirable fellows upon paper:
but as it happens, somewhat unfortunately, that
the men who live in the world are very different
from those who dwell in the heads of philosophers,
it is not to be wondered at if the systems
taken out of books are fit for nothing but to be
put back into books again." And once more:
"They have all that romantic spirit, and all
those romantic ideas of government, which,
happily for America, we were cured of before
it was too late." He shows how they had
never had the chance to gain wisdom through
experience. "As they have hitherto felt severely
the authority exercised in the name of
their princes, every limitation of that power
seems to them desirable. Never having felt
the evils of too weak an executive, the disorders
to be apprehended from anarchy make as yet
no impression." Elsewhere he comments on
their folly in trying to apply to their own
necessities systems of government suited to
totally different conditions; and mentions his
own attitude in the matter: "I have steadily
combated the violence and excess of those persons
who, either inspired with an enthusiastic
love of freedom, or prompted by sinister designs,
are disposed to drive everything to extremity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Our American example has done them good;
but, like all novelties, liberty runs away with
their discretion, if they have any. They want
an American constitution with the exception of
a King instead of a President, without reflecting
that they have not American citizens to support
that constitution.... Whoever desires to apply
in the practical science of government those
rules and forms which prevail and succeed in a
foreign country, must fall into the same pedantry
with our young scholars, just fresh from
the university, who would fain bring everything
to the Roman standard.... The scientific
tailor who should cut after Grecian or Chinese
models would not have many customers, either
in London or Paris; and those who look to
America for their political forms are not unlike
the tailors in Laputa, who, as Gulliver tells us,
always take measures with a quadrant."</p>

<p>He shows again and again his abiding distrust
and fear of the French character, as it was
at that time, volatile, debauched, ferocious, and
incapable of self-restraint. To Lafayette he
insisted that the "extreme licentiousness" of
the people rendered it indispensable that they
should be kept under authority; and on another
occasion told him "that the nation was used to
being governed, and would have to be governed;
and that if he expected to lead them by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
affections, he would himself be the dupe." In
writing to Washington he painted the outlook
in colors that, though black indeed, were not a
shade too dark. "The materials for a revolution
in this country are very indifferent. Everybody
agrees that there is an utter prostration
of morals; but this general proposition can never
convey to an American mind the degree of depravity.
It is not by any figure of rhetoric or
force of language that the idea can be communicated.
A hundred anecdotes and a hundred
thousand examples are required to show the
extreme rottenness of every member. There
are men and women who are greatly and eminently
virtuous. I have the pleasure to number
many in my own acquaintance; but they
stand forward from a background deeply and
darkly shaded. It is however from such crumbling
matter that the great edifice of freedom
is to be erected here. Perhaps like the stratum
of rock which is spread under the whole surface
of their country, it may harden when exposed
to the air; but it seems quite as likely that it
will fall and crush the builders. I own to you
that I am not without such apprehensions, for
there is one fatal principle which pervades all
ranks. It is a perfect indifference to the violation
of engagements. Inconstancy is so mingled
in the blood, marrow, and very essence of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
people, that when a man of high rank and importance
laughs to-day at what he seriously
asserted yesterday, it is considered as in the
natural order of things. Consistency is a phenomenon.
Judge, then, what would be the
value of an association should such a thing be
proposed and even adopted. The great mass of
the common people have no religion but their
priests, no law but their superiors, no morals
but their interest. These are the creatures
who, led by drunken curates, are now on the
high road <i>à la liberté</i>."</p>

<p>Morris and Washington wrote very freely to
each other. In one of his letters, the latter
gave an account of how well affairs were going
in America (save in Rhode Island, the majority
of whose people "had long since bid adieu
to every principle of honor, common sense, and
honesty"), and then went on to discuss things
in France. He expressed the opinion that, if
the revolution went no further than it had already
gone, France would become the most
powerful and happy state in Europe; but he
trembled lest, having triumphed in the first
paroxysms, it might succumb to others still
more violent that would be sure to follow. He
feared equally the "licentiousness of the people"
and the folly of the leaders, and doubted
if they possessed the requisite temperance, firmness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and foresight; and if they did not, then
he believed they would run from one extreme
to another, and end with "a higher toned despotism
than the one which existed before."</p>

<p>Morris answered him with his usual half-satiric
humor: "Your sentiments on the revolution
here I believe to be perfectly just, because
they perfectly accord with my own, and that is,
you know, the only standard which Heaven has
given us by which to judge," and went on to
describe how the parties in France stood. "The
king is in effect a prisoner in Paris and obeys
entirely the National Assembly. This assembly
may be divided into three parts: one, called
the <i>aristocrats</i>, consists of the high clergy, the
members of the law (note, these are not the
lawyers) and such of the nobility as think they
ought to form a separate order. Another, which
has no name, but which consists of all sorts of
people, really friends to a good free government.
The third is composed of what is here
called the <i>enragées</i>, that is, the madmen. These
are the most numerous, and are of that class
which in America is known by the name of
pettifogging lawyers; together with ... those
persons who in all revolutions throng to the
standard of change because they are not well.
This last party is in close alliance with the
populace here, and they have already unhinged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
everything, and, according to custom on such
occasions, the torrent rushes on irresistibly until
it shall have wasted itself." The <i>literati</i> he
pronounced to have no understanding whatever
of the matters at issue, and as was natural to a
shrewd observer educated in the intensely practical
school of American political life, he felt
utter contempt for the wordy futility and wild
theories of the French legislators. "For the
rest, they <i>discuss</i> nothing in their assembly.
One large half of the time is spent in hallooing
and bawling."</p>

<p>Washington and Morris were both so alarmed
and indignant at the excesses committed by the
revolutionists, and so frankly expressed their
feelings, as to create an impression in some
quarters that they were hostile to the revolution
itself. The exact reverse was originally the
case. They sympathized most warmly with the
desire for freedom, and with the efforts made to
attain it. Morris wrote to the President: "We
have, I think, every reason to wish that the
patriots may be successful. The generous wish
that a free people must have to disseminate
freedom, the grateful emotion which rejoices in
the happiness of a benefactor, the interest we
must feel as well in the liberty as in the power
of this country, all conspire to make us far from
indifferent spectators. I say that we have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<i>interest</i> in the liberty of France. The leaders
here are our friends. Many of them have imbibed
their principles in America, and all have
been fired by our example. Their opponents
are by no means rejoiced at the success of our
revolution, and many of them are disposed to
form connections of the strictest kind with
Great Britain." Both Washington and Morris
would have been delighted to see liberty established
in France; but they had no patience with
the pursuit of the bloody chimera which the revolutionists
dignified with that title. The one
hoped for, and the other counseled, moderation
among the friends of republican freedom, not
because they were opposed to it, but because
they saw that it could only be gained and kept
by self-restraint. They were, to say the least,
perfectly excusable for believing that at that
time some form of monarchy, whether under
king, dictator, or emperor, was necessary to
France. Every one agrees that there are certain
men wiser than their fellows; the only
question is as to how these men can be best
chosen out, and to this there can be no absolute
answer. No mode will invariably give the
best results; and the one that will come nearest
to doing so under given conditions will not
work at all under others. Where the people
are enlightened and moral they are themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the ones to choose their rulers; and such a
form of government is unquestionably the highest
of any, and the only one that a high-spirited
and really free nation will tolerate; but if they
are corrupt and degraded, they are unfit for
republicanism, and need to be under an entirely
different system. The most genuine republican,
if he has any common sense, does not believe in
a democratic government for every race and in
every age.</p>

<p>Morris was a true republican, and an American
to the core. He was alike free from truckling
subserviency to European opinion,&mdash;a
degrading remnant of colonialism that unfortunately
still lingers in certain limited social
and literary circles,&mdash;and from the uneasy
self-assertion that springs partly from sensitive
vanity, and partly from a smothered doubt as
to one's real position. Like most men of strong
character, he had no taste for the "cosmopolitanism"
that so generally indicates a weak
moral and mental make-up. He enjoyed his
stay in Europe to the utmost, and was intimate
with the most influential men and charming
women of the time; but he was heartily glad to
get back to America, refused to leave it again,
and always insisted that it was the most pleasant
of all places in which to live. While abroad
he was simply a gentleman among gentlemen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
He never intruded his political views or national
prejudices upon his European friends; but he
was not inclined to suffer any imputation on his
country. Any question about America that
was put in good faith, no matter how much ignorance
it displayed, he always answered good-humoredly;
and he gives in his Diary some
amusing examples of such conversations. Once
he was cross-examined by an inquisitive French
nobleman, still in the stage of civilization which
believes that no man can be paid to render a
service to another, especially a small service,
and yet retain his self-respect and continue to
regard himself as the full political equal of his
employer. One of this gentleman's sagacious
inquiries was as to how a shoemaker could, in
the pride of his freedom, think himself equal to
a king, and yet accept an order to make shoes;
to which Morris replied that he would accept it
as a matter of business, and be glad of the
chance to make them, since it lay in the line of
his duty; and that he would all the time consider
himself at full liberty to criticise his visitor,
or the king, or any one else, who lapsed
from <i>his</i> own duty. After recording several
queries of the same nature, and some rather
abrupt answers, the Diary for that day closes
rather caustically with the comment: "This
manner of thinking and speaking, however, is
too masculine for the climate I am now in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
In a letter to Washington Morris made one
of his usual happy guesses&mdash;if forecasting the
future by the aid of marvelous insight into human
character can properly be called a guess&mdash;as
to what would happen to France: "It is very
difficult to guess whereabouts the flock will settle
when it flies so wild; but as far as it is possible
to guess this (late) kingdom will be cast
into a congeries of little democracies, laid out,
not according to rivers, mountains, etc., but
with the square and compass according to latitude
and longitude," and adds that he thinks
so much fermenting matter will soon give the
nation "a kind of political colic."</p>

<p>He rendered some services to Washington
that did not come in the line of his public duty.
One of these was to get him a watch, Washington
having written to have one purchased
in Paris, of gold, "not a small, trifling, nor a
finical ornamental one, but a watch well executed
in point of workmanship, large and flat,
with a plain, handsome key." Morris sent it
to him by Jefferson, "with two copper keys and
one golden one, and a box containing a spare
spring and glasses." His next service to the
great Virginian, or rather to his family, was of
a different kind, and he records it with a smile
at his own expense. "Go to M. Hudon's; he
has been waiting for me a long time. I stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
for his statue of General Washington, being the
humble employment of a manikin. This is
literally taking the advice of St. Paul, to be
all things to all men."</p>

<p>He corresponded with many men of note;
not the least among whom was the daring corsair,
Paul Jones. The latter was very anxious
to continue in the service of the people with
whom he had cast in his lot, and in command
of whose vessels he had reached fame. Morris
was obliged to tell him that he did not believe
an American navy would be created for some
years to come, and advised him meanwhile to
go into the service of the Russians, as he expected
there would soon be warm work on the
Baltic; and even gave him a hint as to what
would probably be the best plan of campaign.
Paul Jones wanted to come to Paris; but from
this Morris dissuaded him. "A journey to this
city can, I think, produce nothing but the expense
attending it; for neither pleasure nor
profit can be expected here, by one of your
profession in particular; and, except that it is
a more dangerous residence than many others,
I know of nothing which may serve to you as
an inducement."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>LIFE IN PARIS.</h3>

<p>Although Morris entered into the social
life of Paris with all the zest natural to his
pleasure-loving character, yet he was far too
clear-headed to permit it to cast any glamour
over him. Indeed, it is rather remarkable that
a young provincial gentleman, from a raw, new,
far-off country, should not have had his head
turned by being made somewhat of a lion in
what was then the foremost city of the civilized
world. Instead of this happening, his
notes show that he took a perfectly cool view
of his new surroundings, and appreciated the
over-civilized, aristocratic society, in which he
found himself, quite at its true worth. He enjoyed
the life of the salon very much, but it
did not in the least awe or impress him; and he
was of too virile fibre, too essentially a man,
to be long contented with it alone. He likewise
appreciated the fashionable men, and especially
the fashionable women, whom he met
there; but his amusing comments on them, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
shrewd as they are humorous, prove how little
he respected their philosophy, and how completely
indifferent he was to their claims to
social preëminence.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the pleasure-loving,
highly cultured society of eighteenth-century
France; but to a man like Morris, of
real ability and with an element of sturdiness
in his make-up, both the culture and knowledge
looked a little like veneering; the polish
partook of effeminacy; the pleasure so eagerly
sought after could be called pleasure only by
people of ignoble ambition; and the life that
was lived seemed narrow and petty, agreeable
enough for a change, but dreary beyond measure
if followed too long. The authors, philosophers,
and statesmen of the salon were rarely,
almost never, men of real greatness; their
metal did not ring true; they were shams, and
the life of which they were a part was a sham.
Not only was the existence hollow, unwholesome,
effeminate, but also in the end tedious:
the silent, decorous dullness of life in the dreariest
country town is not more insufferable
than, after a time, become the endless chatter,
the small witticisms, the mock enthusiasms, and
vapid affectations of an aristocratic society as
artificial and unsound as that of the Parisian
drawing-rooms in the last century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
But all this was delightful for a time, especially
to a man who had never seen any city
larger than the overgrown villages of New
York and Philadelphia. Morris thus sums up
his first impressions in a letter to a friend: "A
man in Paris lives in a sort of whirlwind,
which turns him round so fast that he can see
nothing. And as all men and things are in the
same vertiginous condition, you can neither fix
yourself nor your object for regular examination.
Hence the people of this metropolis are
under the necessity of pronouncing their definitive
judgment from the first glance; and being
thus habituated to shoot flying, they have what
sportsmen call a quick sight. <i>Ex pede Herculem</i>.
They know a wit by his snuff-box, a
man of taste by his bow, and a statesman by
the cut of his coat. It is true that, like other
sportsmen, they sometimes miss; but then, like
other sportsmen too, they have a thousand excuses
besides the want of skill: the fault, you
know, may be in the dog, or the bird, or the
powder, or the flint, or even the gun, without
mentioning the gunner."</p>

<p>Among the most famous of the salons where
he was fairly constant in his attendance was
that of Madame de Staël. There was not a little
contempt mixed with his regard for the
renowned daughter of Necker. She amused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
him, however, and he thought well of her
capacity, though in his Diary he says that he
never in his life saw "such exuberant vanity"
as she displayed about her father, Necker,&mdash;a
very ordinary personage, whom the convulsions
of the time had for a moment thrown forward
as the most prominent man in France. By
way of instance he mentions a couple of her
remarks, one to the effect that a speech of
Talleyrand on the church property was "excellent,
admirable, in short that there were two
pages in it which were worthy of M. Necker;"
and another wherein she said that wisdom was
a very rare quality, and that she knew of no
one who possessed it in a superlative degree except
her father.</p>

<p>The first time he met her was after an exciting
discussion in the assembly over the
finances, which he describes at some length.
Necker had introduced an absurd scheme for a
loan. Mirabeau, who hated Necker, saw the
futility of his plan, but was also aware that
popular opinion was blindly in his favor, and
that to oppose him would be ruinous; so in a
speech of "fine irony" he advocated passing
Necker's proposed bill without change or discussion,
avowing that his object was to have
the responsibility and glory thrown entirely on
the proposer of the measure. He thus yielded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
to the popular view, while at the same time he
shouldered on Necker all the responsibility for
a deed which it was evident would in the end
ruin him. It was a not very patriotic move,
although a good example of selfish political tactics,
and Morris sneered bitterly at its adoption
by the representatives of a people who prided
themselves on being "the modern Athenians."
To his surprise, however, even Madame de Staël
took Mirabeau's action seriously; she went into
raptures over the wisdom of the assembly in
doing just what Necker said, for "the only
thing they could do was to comply with her
father's wish, and there could be no doubt as
to the success of her father's plans! Bravo!"</p>

<p>With Morris she soon passed from politics
to other subjects. "Presented to Madame de
Staël as <i>un homme d'esprit</i>," he writes, "she
singles me out and makes <i>a talk</i>; asks if I
have not written a book on the American Constitution.
'Non, madame, j'ai fait mon devoir
en assistant à la formation de cette constitution.'
'Mais, monsieur, votre conversation doit
être très intéressante, car je vous entends cité
de toute parti.' 'Ah, madame, je ne suis pas
digne de cette éloge.' How I lost my leg?
It was unfortunately not in the military service
of my country. 'Monsieur, vous avez l'air très
imposant,' and this is accompanied with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
look which, without being what Sir John Falstaff
calls the 'leer of invitation,' amounts to
the same thing.... This leads us on, but in
the midst of the chat arrive letters, one of
which is from her lover, Narbonne, now with
his regiment. It brings her to a little recollection,
which a little time will, I think, again
banish, and a few interviews would stimulate
her to try the experiment of her fascinations
even on the native of a new world who has left
one of his legs behind him."</p>

<p>An entry in Morris's Diary previous to this
conversation shows that he had no very high
opinion of this same Monsieur de Narbonne:
"He considers a civil war inevitable, and is
about to join his regiment, being, as he says, in
a conflict between the dictates of his duty and
his conscience. I tell him that I know of no
duty but that which conscience dictates. I presume
that his conscience will dictate to join the
strongest side."</p>

<p>Morris's surmises as to his fair friend's happy
forgetfulness of her absent lover proved true:
she soon became bent on a flirtation with the
good-looking American stranger, and when he
failed to make any advances she promptly
made them herself; told him that she "rather
invited than repelled those who were inclined
to be attentive," and capped this exhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
modest feminine reserve by suggesting that
"perhaps he might become an admirer." Morris
dryly responded that it was not impossible,
but that, as a previous condition, she must
agree not to repel him,&mdash;which she instantly
promised. Afterwards, at dinner, "we become
engaged in an animated conversation, and she
desires me to speak English, which her husband
does not understand. In looking round
the room, I observe in him very much emotion,
and I tell her that he loves her distractedly,
which she says she knows, and that it renders
her miserable.... I condole with her a little
on her widowhood, the Chevalier de Narbonne
being absent in Franche Comté.... She asks
me if I continue to think she has a preference
for Monsieur de Tonnerre. I reply only by
observing that each of them has wit enough for
one couple, and therefore I think they had better
separate, and take each a partner who is <i>un
peu bête</i>. After dinner I seek a conversation
with the husband, which relieves him. He inveighs
bitterly [poor, honest Swede] against
the manners of the country, and the cruelty of
alienating a wife's affection. I regret with him
on general grounds that prostitution of morals
which unfits them for good government, and
convince him, I think, I shall not contribute to
making him any more uncomfortable than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
already is." Certainly, according to Morris's
evidence, Madame de Staël's sensitive delicacy
could only be truthfully portrayed by the unfettered
pen of a Smollett.</p>

<p>He was an especial <i>habitué</i> of the salon of
Madame de Flahaut, the friend of Talleyrand
and Montesquieu. She was a perfectly characteristic
type; a clever, accomplished little woman,
fond of writing romances, and a thorough-paced
<i>intriguante</i>. She had innumerable enthusiasms,
with perhaps a certain amount of sincerity in
each, and was a more infatuated political
schemer than any of her male friends. She
was thoroughly conversant with the politics of
both court and assembly; her "precision and
justness of thought was very uncommon in
either sex," and, as time went on, made her a
willing and useful helper in some of Morris's
plans. Withal she was a mercenary, self-seeking
little personage, bent on increasing her
own fortune by the aid of her political friends.
Once, when dining with Morris and Talleyrand,
she told them in perfect good faith that,
if the latter was made minister, "they must be
sure to make a million for her."</p>

<p>She was much flattered by the deference that
Morris showed for her judgment, and in return
let him into not a few state secrets. She and
he together drew up a translation of the outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
for a constitution for France, which he had
prepared, and through her it was forwarded to
the king. Together with her two other intimates,
Talleyrand and Montesquieu, they made
just a party of four, often dining at her house;
and when her husband was sent to Spain, the
dinners became more numerous than ever, sometimes
merely <i>parties carrées</i>, sometimes very
large entertainments. Morris records that,
small or large, they were invariably "excellent
dinners, where the conversation was always extremely
gay."</p>

<p>Once they planned out a ministry together,
and it must be kept in mind that it was quite
on the cards that their plan would be adopted.
After disposing suitably of all the notabilities,
some in stations at home, others in stations
abroad, the scheming little lady turned to Morris:
"'Enfin,' she says, 'mon ami, vous et moi
nous gouvernerons la France.' It is an odd
combination, but the kingdom is actually in
much worse hands."</p>

<p>This conversation occurred one morning
when he had called to find madame at her
toilet, with her dentist in attendance. It was
a coarse age, for all the gilding; and the coarseness
was ingrained in the fibre even of the most
ultra sentimental. At first Morris felt perhaps
a little surprised at the easy familiarity with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
which the various ladies whose friend he was
admitted him to the privacy of boudoir and
bedroom, and chronicles with some amusement
the graceful indifference with which one of
them would say to him: "Monsieur Morris me
permettra de faire ma toilette?" But he was
far from being a strait-laced man,&mdash;in fact,
he was altogether too much the reverse,&mdash;and
he soon grew habituated to these as well as to
much worse customs. However, he notes that
the different operations of the toilet "were carried
on with an entire and astounding regard
to modesty."</p>

<p>Madame de Flahaut was a very charming
member of the class who, neither toiling nor
spinning, were supported in luxury by those
who did both, and who died from want while
so doing. At this very time, while France was
rapidly drifting into bankruptcy, the fraudulent
pensions given to a horde of courtiers, titled
placemen, well-born harlots and their offspring,
reached the astounding total of two hundred
and seventy odd millions of livres. The assembly
passed a decree cutting away these pensions
right and left, and thereby worked sad havoc
in the gay society that nothing could render
serious but immediate and pressing poverty,&mdash;not
even the loom of the terror ahead, growing
darker moment by moment. Calling on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
fascinating little friend immediately after the
decree was published, Morris finds her "<i>au
désespoir</i>, and she intends to cry very loud, she
says.... She has been in tears all day. Her
pensions from Monsieur and the Comte d'Artois
are stopped. On that from the king she receives
but three thousand francs,&mdash;and must
therefore quit Paris. I try to console her, but
it is impossible. Indeed, the stroke is severe;
for, with youth, beauty, wit, and every loveliness,
she must quit all she loves, and pass her
life with what she abhors." In the time of adversity
Morris stood loyally by the friends who
had treated him so kindly when the world was
a merry one, and things went well with them.
He helped them in every way possible; his
time and his purse were always at their service;
and he performed the difficult feat of giving pecuniary
assistance with a tact and considerate
delicacy that prevented the most sensitive from
taking offense.</p>

<p>He early became acquainted with the Duchess
of Orleans, wife of Philippe Egalité, the vicious
voluptuary of liberal leanings and clouded character.
He met her at the house of an old friend,
Madame de Chastellux. At first he did not
fancy her, and rather held himself aloof, being
uncertain "how he would get on with royalty."
The duchess, however, was attracted by him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
asked after him repeatedly, made their mutual
friends throw them together, and finally so managed
that he became one of her constant visitors
and attendants. This naturally flattered him,
and he remained sincerely loyal to her always
afterwards. She was particularly anxious that
he should be interested in her son, then a boy,
afterwards destined to become the citizen king,&mdash;not
a bad man, but a mean one, and rather
an unkingly king even for the nineteenth century,
fertile though it has been in ignoble royalty.
Morris's further dealings with this precious
youth will have to be considered hereafter.</p>

<p>After his first interview he notes that the
duchess was "handsome enough to punish the
duke for his irregularities." He also mentioned
that she still seemed in love with her husband.
However, the lady was not averse to seeking
a little sentimental consolation from her new
friend, to whom she confided, in their after intimacy,
that she was weary at heart and not
happy, and&mdash;a thoroughly French touch&mdash;that
she had the "besoin d'être aimée." On the day
they first met, while he is talking to her, "the
widow of the late Duke of Orleans comes in, and
at going away, according to custom, kisses the
duchess. I observe that the ladies of Paris are
very fond of each other; which gives rise to some
observations from her royal highness on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
person who has just quitted the room, which
show that the kiss does not always betoken great
affection. In going away she is pleased to say
that she is glad to have met me, and I believe
her. The reason is that I dropped some expressions
and sentiments a little rough, which
were agreeable because they contrasted with
the palling polish she meets with everywhere.
Hence I conclude that the less I have the honor
of such good company the better; for when the
novelty ceases all is over, and I shall probably
be worse than insipid."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the "good company" was determined
he should make one of their number.
He was not very loath himself, when he found
he was in no danger of being patronized,&mdash;for
anything like patronage was always particularly
galling to his pride, which was of the kind that
resents a tone of condescension more fiercely
than an overt insult,&mdash;and he became a fast
friend of the house of Orleans. The duchess
made him her confidant; unfolded to him her
woes about the duke; and once, when he was
dining with her, complained to him bitterly of
the duke's conduct in not paying her allowance
regularly. She was in financial straits at the
time; for, though she was allowed four hundred
and fifty thousand livres a year, yet three hundred
and fifty thousand were appropriated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the house-servants, table, etc.,&mdash;an item wherein
her American friend, albeit not over-frugal,
thought a very little economy would result in
a great saving.</p>

<p>His description of one of the days he spent
at Raincy with the duchess and her friends,
gives us not only a glimpse of the life of the
great ladies and fine gentlemen of the day, but
also a clear insight into the reasons why these
same highly polished ladies and gentlemen had
utterly lost their hold over the people whose
God-given rulers they deemed themselves to be.</p>

<p><i>Déjeuner à la fourchette</i> was not served till
noon,&mdash;Morris congratulating himself that he
had taken a light breakfast earlier. "After
breakfast we go to mass in the chapel. In the
tribune above we have a bishop, an abbé, the
duchess, her maids and some of their friends.
Madame de Chastellux is below on her knees.
We are amused above by a number of little
tricks played off by Monsieur de Ségur and
Monsieur de Cabières with a candle, which is
put into the pockets of different gentlemen, the
bishop among the rest, and lighted, while they
are otherwise engaged, (for there is a fire in
the tribune,) to the great merriment of the
spectators. Immoderate laughter is the consequence.
The duchess preserves as much gravity
as she can. This scene must be very edifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to the domestics who are opposite to us,
and the villagers who worship below." The
afternoon's amusements were not to his taste.
They all walked, which he found very hot;
then they got into bateaux, and the gentlemen
rowed the ladies, which was still hotter; and
then there came more walking, so he was glad
to get back to the château. The formal dinner
was served after five; the conversation thereat
varied between the vicious and the frivolous.
There was much bantering, well-bred in manner
and excessively under-bred in matter, between
the different guests of both sexes, about
the dubious episodes in their past careers, and
the numerous shady spots in their respective
characters. Epigrams and "epitaphs" were
bandied about freely, some in verse, some not;
probably very amusing then, but their lustre
sadly tarnished in the eyes of those who read
them now. While they were dining, "a number
of persons surround the windows, doubtless
from a high idea of the company, to whom they
are obliged to look up at an awful distance.
Oh, did they but know how trivial the conversation,
how very trivial the characters, their
respect would soon be changed to an emotion
entirely different!"</p>

<p>This was but a month before the Bastile
fell; and yet, on the threshold of their hideous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
doom, the people who had most at stake were
incapable not only of intelligent action to ward
off their fate, but even of serious thought as to
what their fate would be. The men&mdash;the
nobles, the clerical dignitaries, and the princes
of the blood&mdash;chose the church as a place
wherein to cut antics that would have better
befitted a pack of monkeys; while the women,
their wives and mistresses, exchanged with
them impure jests at their own expense, relished
because of the truth on which they rested.
Brutes might still have held sway at least for
a time; but these were merely vicious triflers.
They did not believe in their religion; they
did not believe in themselves; they did not believe
in anything. They had no earnestness,
no seriousness; their sensibilities and enthusiasms
were alike affectations. There was still
plenty of fire and purpose and furious energy
in the hearts of the French people; but these
and all the other virile virtues lay not among
the noblesse, but among the ranks of the common
herd beneath them, down-trodden, bloody
in their wayward ferocity, but still capable of
fierce, heroic devotion to an ideal in which
they believed, and for which they would spill
the blood of others, or pour out their own, with
the proud waste of utter recklessness.</p>

<p>Many of Morris's accounts of the literary life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of the salon read as if they were explanatory
notes to "Les Précieuses Ridicules." There
was a certain pretentiousness about it that made
it a bit of a sham at the best; and the feebler
variety of salon, built on such a foundation,
thus became that most despicable of things, an
imitation of a pretense. At one of the dinners
which Morris describes, the company was of a
kind that would have done no discredit to an
entertainment of the great social and literary
light of Eatanswill. "Set off in great haste to
dine with the Comtesse de R., on an invitation
of a week's standing. Arrive at about a quarter
past three, and find in the drawing-room
some dirty linen and no fire. While a waiting-woman
takes away one, a valet lights up
the other. Three small sticks in a deep bed of
ashes give no great expectation of heat. By
the smoke, however, all doubts are removed
respecting the existence of fire. To expel the
smoke, a window is opened, and, the day being
cold, I have the benefit of as fresh air as can
reasonably be expected in so large a city.</p>

<p>"Towards four o'clock the guests begin to
assemble, and I begin to expect that, as madame
is a poetess, I shall have the honor to dine with
that exalted part of the species who devote
themselves to the muses. In effect, the gentlemen
begin to compliment their respective works;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and, as regular hours cannot be expected in a
house where the mistress is occupied more with
the intellectual than the material world, I have
a delightful prospect of a continuance of the
scene. Towards five, madame steps in to announce
dinner, and the hungry poets advance
to the charge. As they bring good appetites,
they have certainly reason to praise the feast.
And I console myself with the persuasion that
for this day at least I shall escape an indigestion.
A very narrow escape, too, for some rancid butter,
of which the cook had been liberal, puts me
in bodily fear. If the repast is not abundant,
we have at least the consolation that there is
no lack of conversation. Not being perfectly
master of the language, most of the jests escaped
me. As for the rest of the company,
each being employed either in saying a good
thing, or else in studying one to say, it is no
wonder if he cannot find time to applaud that
of his neighbors. They all agree that we live
in an age alike deficient in justice and in taste.
Each finds in the fate of his own works numerous
instances to justify this censure. They tell
me, to my great surprise, that the public now
condemn theatrical compositions before they
have heard the first recital. And, to remove
my doubts, the comtesse is so kind as to assure
me that this rash decision has been made on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
one of her own pieces. In pitying modern degeneracy,
we rise from the table.</p>

<p>"I take my leave immediately after the coffee,
which by no means dishonors the precedent
repast; and madame informs me that on
Tuesdays and Thursdays she is always at home,
and will always be glad to see me. While I
stammer out some return to the compliment,
my heart, convinced of my unworthiness to partake
of such attic entertainments, makes me
promise never again to occupy the place from
which perhaps I had excluded a worthier personage."</p>

<p>Among Morris's other qualities, he was the
first to develop that peculiarly American vein
of humor which is especially fond of gravely
pretending to believe without reserve some preposterously
untrue assertion,&mdash;as throughout
the above quotation.</p>

<p>Though the society in which he was thrown
interested him, he always regarded it with half-sarcastic
amusement, and at times it bored him
greatly. Meditating on the conversation in
"this upper region of wits and graces," he
concludes that "the sententious style" is the
one best fitted for it, and that in it "observations
with more of justice than splendor cannot
amuse," and sums up by saying that "he
could not please, because he was not sufficiently
pleased."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
His comments upon the various distinguished
men he met are always interesting, on account
of the quick, accurate judgment of character
which they show. It was this insight into the
feelings and ideas alike of the leaders and of
their followers which made his political predictions
often so accurate. His judgment of many
of his contemporaries comes marvelously near
the cooler estimate of history.</p>

<p>He was originally prejudiced in favor of the
king, poor Louis XVI., and, believing him "to
be an honest and good man, he sincerely wished
him well," but he very soon began to despise
him for his weakness. This quality was the
exact one that under existing circumstances was
absolutely fatal; and Morris mentions it again
and again, pronouncing the king "a well-meaning
man, but extremely weak, without genius
or education to show the way towards that
good which he desires," and "a prince so weak
that he can influence very little either by his
presence or absence." Finally, in a letter to
Washington, he gives a biting sketch of the
unfortunate monarch. "If the reigning prince
were not the small-beer character that he is,
there can be but little doubt that, watching
events and making a tolerable use of them, he
would regain his authority; but what will you
have from a creature who, situated as he is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
eats and drinks, sleeps well and laughs, and is
as merry a grig as lives? The idea that they
will give him some money, which he can economize,
and that he will have no trouble in governing,
contents him entirely. Poor man! He
little thinks how unstable is his situation. He
is beloved, but it is not with the sort of love
which a monarch should inspire. It is that
kind of good-natured pity which one feels for a
led captive. There is besides no possibility of
serving him, for at the slightest show of opposition
he gives up everything and every person."
Morris had too robust a mind to feel the least
regard for mere amiability and good intentions
when unaccompanied by any of the ruder, manlier
virtues.</p>

<p>The Count d'Artois had "neither sense to
counsel himself, nor to choose counsellors for
himself, much less to counsel others." This
gentleman, afterwards Charles X., stands as
perhaps the most shining example of the monumental
ineptitude of his royal house. His
fellow Bourbon, the amiable Bomba of Naples,
is his only equal for dull silliness, crass immorality,
and the lack of every manly or kingly
virtue. Democracy has much to answer for,
but after all it would be hard to find, even
among the aldermen of New York and Chicago,
men whose moral and mental shortcomings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
would put them lower than this royal
couple. To our shame be it said, our system
of popular government once let our greatest
city fall under the control of Tweed; but it
would be rank injustice to that clever rogue to
compare him with the two vicious dullards
whom the opposite system permitted to tyrannize
at Paris and Naples. Moreover, in the
end, we of the democracy not only overthrew
the evil-doer who oppressed us, but also put
him in prison; and in the long run we have
usually meted out the same justice to our lesser
criminals. Government by manhood suffrage
shows at its worst in large cities; and yet even
in these experience certainly does not show
that a despotism works a whit better, or as
well.</p>

<p>Morris described the Count de Montmorin
pithily, saying: "He has more understanding
than people in general imagine, and he means
well, very well, but he means it feebly."</p>

<p>When Morris came to France, Necker was the
most prominent man in the kingdom. He was
a hard-working, well-meaning, conceited person,
not in the least fitted for public affairs, a banker
but not a financier, and affords a beautiful illustration
of the utter futility of the popular belief
that a good business man will necessarily be a
good statesman. Accident had made him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
most conspicuous figure of the government, admired
and hated, but not looked down upon;
yet Morris saw through him at a glance. After
their first meeting, he writes down in his diary:
"He has the look and manner of the counting-house,
and, being dressed in embroidered velvet,
he contrasts strongly with his habiliments.
His bow, his address, say, 'I am the man.' ...
If he is really a very great man, I am deceived;
and yet this is a rash judgment. If he is not a
laborious man, I am also deceived." He soon
saw that both the blame and the praise bestowed
on him were out of all proportion to his consequence,
and he wrote: "In their anguish [the
nobles] curse Necker, who is in fact less the
cause than the instrument of their sufferings.
His popularity depends now more on the opposition
he meets with from one party than any
serious regard of the other. It is the attempt
to throw him down which saves him from falling; ... as
it is, he must soon fall." To
Washington he gave a fuller analysis of his
character. "As to M. Necker, he is one of
those people who has obtained a much greater
reputation than he has any right to.... In
his public administration he has always been
honest and disinterested; which proves well, I
think, for his former private conduct, or else it
proves that he has more vanity than cupidity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Be that as it may, an unspotted integrity as
minister, and serving at his own expense in an
office which others seek for the purpose of enriching
themselves, have acquired for him very
deservedly much confidence. Add to this that
his writings on finance teem with that sort of
sensibility which makes the fortune of modern
romances, and which is exactly suited to this
lively nation, who love to read but hate to think.
Hence his reputation. He ... [has not] the
talents of a great minister. His education as a
banker has taught him to make tight bargains,
and put him upon his guard against projects.
But though he understands man as a covetous
creature, he does not understand mankind,&mdash;a
defect which is remediless. He is utterly ignorant
of politics, by which I mean politics in the
great sense, or that sublime science which embraces
for its object the happiness of mankind.
Consequently he neither knows what constitution
to form, nor how to obtain the consent of
others to such as he wishes. From the moment
of convening the states-general, he has been
afloat upon the wide ocean of incidents. But
what is most extraordinary is that M. Necker
is a very poor financier. This I know will
sound like heresy in the ears of most people,
but it is true. The plans he has proposed are
feeble and inept."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
A far more famous man, Talleyrand, then
Bishop of Autun, he also gauged correctly from
the start, writing down that he appeared to be
"a sly, cool, cunning, ambitious, and malicious
man. I know not why conclusions so disadvantageous
to him are formed in my mind, but so
it is, and I cannot help it." He was afterwards
obliged to work much in common with Talleyrand,
for both took substantially the same view
of public affairs in that crisis, and were working
for a common end. Speaking of his new ally's
plan respecting church property, he says: "He
is bigoted to it, and the thing is well enough;
but the mode is not so well. He is attached to
this <i>as an author</i>, which is not a good sign for
a man of business." And again he criticises
Talleyrand's management of certain schemes
for the finances, as showing a willingness "to
sacrifice great objects for the sake of small
ones ... an inverse ratio of moral proportion."</p>

<p>Morris was fond of Lafayette, and appreciated
highly his courage and keen sense of
honor; but he did not think much of his ability,
and became at times very impatient with
his vanity and his impractical theories. Besides,
he deemed him a man who was carried
away by the current, and could neither stem
nor guide it. "I have known my friend Lafayette
now for many years, and can estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
at the just value both his words and actions.
He means ill to no one, but he is very much
below the business he has undertaken; and if
the sea runs high, he will be unable to hold the
helm." And again, in writing to Washington:
"Unluckily he has given in to measures ...
which he does not heartily approve, and he
heartily approves many things which experience
will demonstrate to be dangerous."</p>

<p>The misshapen but mighty genius of Mirabeau
he found more difficulty in estimating;
he probably never rated it quite high enough.
He naturally scorned a man of such degraded
debauchery, who, having been one of the great
inciters to revolution, had now become a subsidized
ally of the court. He considered him
"one of the most unprincipled scoundrels that
ever lived," although of "superior talents," and
"so profligate that he would disgrace any administration,"
besides having so little principle as
to make it unsafe to trust him. After his death
he thus sums him up: "Vices both degrading
and detestable marked this extraordinary
being. Completely prostitute, he sacrificed
everything to the whim of the moment;&mdash;<i>cupidus
alieni prodigus sui</i>; venal, shameless; and
yet greatly virtuous when pushed by a prevailing
impulse, but never truly virtuous, because
never under the steady control of reason, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the firm authority of principle. I have seen
this man, in the short space of two years, hissed,
honored, hated, mourned. Enthusiasm has just
now presented him gigantic. Time and reflection
will sink this stature." Even granting this
to be wholly true, as it undoubtedly is in the
main, it was nevertheless the fact that in Mirabeau
alone lay the least hope of salvation for
the French nation; and Morris erred in strenuously
opposing Lafayette's going into a ministry
with him. Indeed, he seems in this case to have
been blinded by prejudice, and certainly acted
very inconsistently; for his advice, and the reasons
he gave for it, were completely at variance
with the rules he himself laid down to Lafayette,
with even more cynicism than common
sense, when the latter once made some objections
to certain proposed coadjutors of his: "I
state to him ... that, as to the objections he
has made on the score of morals in some, he
must consider that men do not go into an administration
as the direct road to heaven;
that they are prompted by ambition or avarice,
and therefore that the only way to secure
the most virtuous is by making it their interest
to act rightly."</p>

<p>Morris thus despised the king, and distrusted
the chief political leaders; and, as he wrote
Washington, he was soon convinced that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
was an immense amount of corruption in the
upper circles. The people at large he disliked
even more than he did their advisers, and he
had good grounds, too, as the following extract
from his journal shows: "July 22d. After dinner,
walk a little under the arcade of the Palais
Royal, waiting for my carriage. In this period
the head and body of M. de Toulon are introduced
in triumph, the head on a pike, the body
dragged naked on the earth. Afterwards this
horrible exhibition is carried through the different
streets. His crime is, to have accepted a
place in the ministry. This mutilated form of
an old man of seventy-five is shown to his son-in-law,
Berthier, the intendant of Paris; and
afterwards he also is put to death and cut to
pieces, the populace carrying about the mangled
fragments with a savage joy. Gracious God,
what a people!"</p>

<p>He describes at length, and most interestingly,
the famous opening of the states-general,
"the beginning of the Revolution." He eyed
this body even at the beginning with great distrust;
and he never thought that any of the
delegates showed especial capacity for grappling
with the terrible dangers and difficulties
by which they were encompassed. He comments
on the extreme enthusiasm with which
the king was greeted, and sympathizes strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
with Marie Antoinette, who was treated with
studied and insulting coldness. "She was exceedingly
hurt. I cannot help feeling the mortification
which the poor queen meets with, for
I see only the woman; and it seems unmanly
to treat a woman with unkindness.... Not
one voice is heard to wish her well. I would
certainly raise mine if I were a Frenchman;
but I have no right to express a sentiment, and
in vain solicit those who are near me to do it."
... At last "the queen rises, and, to my great
satisfaction, she hears, for the first time in
several months, the sound of '<i>Vive la reine!</i>'
She makes a low courtesy, and this produces a
louder acclamation, and that a lower courtesy."</p>

<p>The sympathy was for the woman, not the
queen, the narrow-minded, absolute sovereign,
the intriguer against popular government, whose
policy was as heavily fraught with bale for the
nation as was that of Robespierre himself. The
king was more than competent to act as his own
evil genius; had he not been, Marie Antoinette
would have amply filled the place.</p>

<p>He characterized the carrying of "that diabolical
castle," the Bastile, as "among the most
extraordinary things I have met with." The
day it took place he wrote in his journal, with
an irony very modern in its flavor: "Yesterday
it was the fashion at Versailles not to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
that there were any disturbances at Paris. I
presume that this day's transactions will induce
a conviction that all is not perfectly quiet."</p>

<p>He used the Bastile as a text when, shortly
afterwards, he read a brief lesson to a certain
eminent painter. The latter belonged to that
class of artists with pen or pencil (only too
plentiful in America at the present day) who
always insist on devoting their energies to depicting
subjects worn threadbare by thousands
of predecessors, instead of working in the new,
broad fields, filled with picturesque material,
opened to them by their own country and its
history. "The painter shows us a piece he is
now about for the king, taken from the Æneid:
Venus restraining the arm which is raised in
the temple of the Vestals to shed the blood of
Helen. I tell him he had better paint the
storm of the Bastile."</p>

<h3>MISSION TO ENGLAND: RETURN TO PARIS.</h3>

<p>In March, 1790, Morris went to London, in
obedience to a letter received from Washington
appointing him private agent to the British
government, and enclosing him the proper credentials.</p>

<p>Certain of the conditions of the treaty of
peace between Great Britain and the United
States, although entered into seven years before,
were still unfulfilled. It had been stipulated
that the British should give up the fortified
frontier posts within our territory, and should
pay for the negroes they had taken away from
the Southern States during the war. They had
done neither, and Morris was charged to find
out what the intentions of the government were
in the matter. He was also to find out whether
there was a disposition to enter into a commercial
treaty with the United States; and finally,
he was to sound them as to their sending a minister
to America.</p>

<p>On our part we had also failed to fulfil a portion
of our treaty obligations, not having complied
with the article which provided for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
payment of debts due before the war to British
merchants. Both sides had been to blame;
each, of course, blamed only the other. But
now, when we were ready to perform our part,
the British refused to perform theirs.</p>

<p>As a consequence, Morris, although he spent
most of the year in London, failed to accomplish
anything. The feeling in England was hostile
to America; to the king, in particular, the very
name was hateful. The English were still sore
over their defeat, and hated us because we had
been victors; and yet they despised us also, for
they thought we should be absolutely powerless
except when we were acting merely on the
defensive. From the days of the Revolution
till the days of the Civil War, the ruling classes
of England were bitterly antagonistic to our
nation; they always saw with glee any check
to our national well-being: they wished us ill,
and exulted in our misfortunes, while they
sneered at our successes. The results have
been lasting, and now work much more to their
hurt than to ours. The past conduct of England
certainly offers much excuse for, though
it cannot in the least justify, the unreasonable
and virulent anti-English feeling&mdash;that is, the
feeling against Englishmen politically and nationally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
not socially or individually&mdash;which is
so strong in many parts of our country where
the native American blood is purest.</p>

<p>The English ministry in 1790 probably had
the general feeling of the nation behind them
in their determination to injure us as much as
they could; at any rate, their aim seemed to
be, as far as lay in them, to embitter our already
existing hostility to their empire. They
not only refused to grant us any substantial
justice, but they were inclined to inflict on us
and on our representatives those petty insults
which rankle longer than injuries.</p>

<p>When it came to this point, however, Morris
was quite able to hold his own. He had a
ready, biting tongue; and, excepting Pitt and
Fox, was intellectually superior to any of the
public men whom he met. In social position,
even as they understood it, he was their equal;
they could hardly look down on the brother of
a British major-general, and a brother-in-law
of the Duchess of Gordon. He was a man of
rather fiery courage, and any attacks upon his
country were not likely to be made twice in his
presence. Besides, he never found the English
congenial as friends or companions; he could
not sympathize, or indeed get along well, with
them. This distaste for their society he always
retained, and though he afterwards grew to respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
them, and to be their warm partisan politically,
he was at this time much more friendly
to France, and was even helping the French
ministers concoct a scheme of warfare against
their neighbor. To his bright, impatient temperament,
the English awkwardness seemed to
be an insuperable obstacle to bringing people
together "as in other countries." He satirized
the English drawing-rooms, "where the arrangement
of the company was stiff and formal, the
ladies all ranged in battalia on one side of the
room;" and remarked "that the French, having
no liberty in their government, have compensated
to themselves that misfortune by bestowing
a great deal upon society. But that, I fear, in
England, is all confined to the House of Commons."
Years afterwards he wrote to a friend
abroad: "Have you reflected that there is more
of real society in one week at [a Continental
watering-place] than in a London year? Recollect
that a tedious morning, a great dinner, a
boozy afternoon, and dull evening make the
sum total of English life. It is admirable for
young men who shoot, hunt, drink,&mdash;but for
us! How are we to dispose of ourselves? No.
Were I to give you a rendezvous in Europe, it
should be on the continent. I respect, as you
know, the English nation highly, and love many
individuals among them, but I do not love their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
manners." Times have changed, and the manners
of the Islanders with them. Exactly as
the "rude Carinthian boor" has become the
most polished of mortals, so, after a like transformation,
English society is now perhaps the
pleasantest and most interesting in Europe.
Were Morris alive to-day, he would probably
respect the English as much as he ever did,
and like them a good deal more; and, while he
might well have his preference for his own
country confirmed, yet, if he had to go abroad,
it is hard to believe that he would now pass by
London in favor of any continental capital or
watering-place.</p>

<p>In acknowledging Washington's letter of appointment,
Morris wrote that he did not expect
much difficulty, save from the king himself,
who was very obstinate, and bore a personal
dislike to his former subjects. But his interviews
with the minister of foreign affairs, the
Duke of Leeds, soon undeceived him. The
duke met him with all the little tricks of delay,
and evasion, known to old-fashioned diplomacy;
tricks that are always greatly relished
by men of moderate ability, and which are successful
enough where the game is not very important,
as in the present instance, but are
nearly useless when the stakes are high and the
adversary determined. The worthy nobleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
was profuse in expressions of general good-will,
and vague to a degree in his answers to every
concrete question; affected to misunderstand
what was asked of him, and, when he could not
do this "slumbered profoundly" for weeks before
making his reply. Morris wrote that "his
explanatory comments were more unintelligible
than his texts," and was delighted when he
heard that he might be replaced by Lord
Hawksbury; for the latter, although strongly
anti-American, "would at least be an efficient
minister," whereas the former was "evidently
afraid of committing himself by saying or doing
anything positive." He soon concluded that
Great Britain was so uncertain as to how matters
were going in Europe that she wished to
keep us in a similar state of suspense. She had
recovered with marvelous rapidity from the
effects of the great war; she was felt on all
sides to hold a position of commanding power;
this she knew well, and so felt like driving a
very hard bargain with any nation, especially
with a weak one that she hated. It was particularly
difficult to form a commercial treaty.
There were very many Englishmen who agreed
with a Mr. Irwin, "a mighty sour sort of creature,"
who assured Morris that he was utterly
opposed to all American trade in grain, and
that he wished to oblige the British people, by
the force of starvation, to raise enough corn for
their own consumption. Fox told Morris that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
he and Burke were about the only two men left
who believed that Americans should be allowed
to trade in their own bottoms to the British
Islands; and he also informed him that Pitt
was not hostile to America, but simply indifferent,
being absorbed in European matters, and
allowing his colleagues free hands.</p>

<p>Becoming impatient at the long-continued
delay, Morris finally wrote, very courteously
but very firmly, demanding some sort of answer,
and this produced a momentary activity, and
assurances that he was under a misapprehension
as to the delay, etc. The subject of the
impressment of American sailors into British
men-of-war,&mdash;a matter of chronic complaint
throughout our first forty years of national life,&mdash;now
came up; and he remarked to the
Duke of Leeds, with a pithy irony that should
have made the saying famous: "I believe, my
lord, that this is the only instance in which we
are not treated as aliens." He proposed a plan
which would have at least partially obviated
the difficulties in the way of a settlement of
the matter, but the duke would do nothing.
Neither would he come to any agreement in
reference to the exchange of ministers between
the two countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Then came an interview with Pitt, and Morris,
seeing how matters stood, now spoke out
perfectly clearly. In answer to the accusations
about our failure wholly to perform certain stipulations
of the treaty, after reciting the counter
accusations of the Americans, he brushed
them all aside with the remark: "But, sir,
what I have said tends to show that these complaints
and inquiries are excellent if the parties
mean to keep asunder; if they wish to come together,
all such matters should be kept out of
sight." He showed that the House of Representatives,
in a friendly spirit, had recently decided
against laying extraordinary restrictions
on British vessels in our ports. "Mr. Pitt said
that, instead of restrictions, we ought to give
them particular privileges, in return for those
we enjoy here. I assured him that I knew of
none except that of being impressed, a privilege
which of all others we least wished to partake
of.... Mr. Pitt said seriously that they had
certainly evinced good-will to us by what they
had done respecting our commerce. I replied
therefore, with like seriousness, that their regulations
had been dictated with a view to their
own interests; and therefore, as we felt no favor,
we owed no obligation." Morris realized
thoroughly that they were keeping matters in
suspense because their behavior would depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
upon the contingencies of war or peace with the
neighboring powers; he wished to show that,
if they acted thus, we would also bide our time
till the moment came to strike a telling blow;
and accordingly he ended by telling Pitt, with
straightforward directness, a truth that was
also a threat: "We do not think it worth
while to go to war with you for the [frontier]
forts; but we know our rights, and will avail
ourselves of them when time and circumstances
may suit."</p>

<p>After this conversation he became convinced
that we should wait until England herself felt
the necessity of a treaty before trying to negotiate
one. He wrote Washington "that those
who, pursuing the interests of Great Britain,
wish to be on the best terms with America, are
outnumbered by those whose sour prejudice
and hot resentment render them averse to any
intercourse except that which may immediately
subserve a selfish policy. These men do not yet
know America. Perhaps America does not
yet know herself.... We are yet in but the
seeding-time of national prosperity, and it will
be well not to mortgage the crop before it is
gathered.... England will not, I am persuaded,
enter into a treaty with us unless we
give for it more than it is worth now, and infinitely
more than it will be worth hereafter.
A present bargain would be that of a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
heir with an old usurer.... But, should war
break out [with a European power], the anti-American
party here will agree to <i>any</i> terms;
for it is more the taste of the medicine which
they nauseate than the quantity of the dose."</p>

<p>Accordingly all negotiations were broken off.
In America his enemies blamed Morris for this
failure. They asserted that his haughty manners
and proud bearing had made him unpopular
with the ministers, and that his consorting
with members of the opposition had still further
damaged his cause. The last assertion was
wholly untrue; for he had barely more than
met Fox and his associates. But on a third
point there was genuine reason for dissatisfaction.
Morris had confided his purpose to the
French minister at London, M. de la Luzerne,
doing so because he trusted to the latter's honor,
and did not wish to seem to take any steps unknown
to our ally; and he was in all probability
also influenced by his constant association and
intimacy with the French leaders. Luzerne,
however, promptly used the information for his
own purposes, letting the English ministers
know that he was acquainted with Morris's objects,
and thus increasing the weight of France
by making it appear that America acted only
with her consent and advice. The affair curiously
illustrates Jay's wisdom eight years before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
when he insisted on keeping Luzerne's superior
at that time, Vergennes, in the dark as
to our course during the peace negotiations.
However, it is not at all likely that Mr. Pitt
or the Duke of Leeds were influenced in their
course by anything Luzerne said.</p>

<p>Leaving London, Morris made a rapid trip
through the Netherlands and up the Rhine.
His journals, besides the usual comments on the
inns, the bad roads, poor horses, sulky postilions,
and the like, are filled with very interesting
observations on the character of the country
through which he passed, its soil and inhabitants,
and the indications they afforded of the
national resources. He liked to associate with
people of every kind, and he was intensely fond
of natural scenery; but, what seems rather
surprising in a man of his culture, he apparently
cared very little for the great cathedrals,
the picture galleries, and the works of art
for which the old towns he visited were so
famous.</p>

<p>He reached Paris at the end of November,
but was almost immediately called to London
again, returning in January, 1791, and making
three or four similar trips in the course of the
year. His own business affairs took up a great
deal of his time. He was engaged in very
many different operations, out of which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
made a great deal of money, being a shrewd
business man with a strong dash of the speculator.
He had to prosecute a suit against the
farmers-general of France for a large quantity
of tobacco shipped them by contract; and he
gives a very amusing description of the visits
he made to the judges before whom the case
was to be tried. Their occupations were certainly
various, being those of a farrier, a goldsmith,
a grocer, a currier, a woolen draper, and
a bookseller respectively. As a sample of his
efforts, take the following: "Return home and
dine. At five resume my visits to my judges,
and first wait upon the honorable M. Gillet, the
grocer, who is in a little cuddy adjoining his
shop, at cards. He assures me that the court
are impartial, and alike uninfluenced by farmers,
receivers, and grand seigneurs; that they are
generally of the same opinion; that he will do
everything in his power; and the like. <i>De
l'autre côté</i>, perfect confidence in the ability
and integrity of the court. Wish only to bring
the cause to such a point as that I may have
the honor to present a memorial. Am vastly
sorry to have been guilty of an intrusion upon
the amusements of his leisure hours. Hope he
will excuse the solicitude of a stranger, and patronize
a claim of such evident justice. The
whole goes off very well, though I with difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
restrain my risible faculties.... A disagreeable
scene, the ridicule of which is so strongly
painted to my own eyes that I cannot forbear
laughing."</p>

<p>He also contracted to deliver Necker twenty
thousand barrels of flour for the relief of Paris;
wherein, by the way, he lost heavily. He took
part in sundry shipping operations. Perhaps the
most lucrative business in which he was engaged
was in negotiating the sale of wild lands in
America. He even made many efforts to buy
the Virginian and Pennsylvanian domains of
the Fairfaxes and the Penns. On behalf of a
syndicate, he endeavored to purchase the American
debts to France and Spain; these being
purely speculative efforts, as it was supposed
that the debts could be obtained at quite a low
figure, while, under the new Constitution, the
United States would certainly soon make arrangements
for paying them off. These various
operations entailed a wonderful amount of
downright hard work; yet all the while he remained
not only a close observer of French politics,
but, to a certain extent, even an actor in
them.</p>

<p>He called upon Lafayette as soon as he was
again established in Paris, after his mission to
London. He saw that affairs had advanced to
such a pitch in France that "it was no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
a question of liberty, but simply who shall be
master." He had no patience with those who
wished the king to place himself, as they phrased
it, at the head of the Revolution, remarking:
"The trade of a revolutionist appears to me
a hard one for a prince." What with the folly
of one side and the madness of the other, things
were going to pieces very rapidly. At one of
his old haunts, the club, the "sentiment aristocratique"
had made great headway: one of his
friends, De Moustin, now in favor with the king
and queen, was "as usual on the high ropes of
royal prerogative." Lafayette, however, was
still wedded to his theories, and did not appear
over-glad to see his American friend, all whose
ideas and habits of thought were so opposed to
his own; while madame was still cooler in her
reception. Morris, nothing daunted, talked to
his friend very frankly and seriously. He told
him that the time had come when all good citizens
would be obliged, simply from lack of
choice, to cling to the throne; that the executive
must be strengthened, and good and able
men put into the council. He pronounced the
"thing called a constitution" good for nothing,
and showed that the National Assembly was
rapidly falling into contempt. He pointed out,
for the hundredth time, that each country needed
to have its own form of government; that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
American constitution would not do for France,
for the latter required an even higher-toned
system than that of England; and that, above
all things, France needed stability. He gave
the reasons for his advice clearly and forcibly;
but poor Lafayette flinched from it, and could
not be persuaded to take any effectual step.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read Morris's shrewd comments
on the events of the day, and his plans
in reference to them, without wondering that
France herself should at the crisis have failed
to produce any statesmen to be compared with
him for force, insight, and readiness to do what
was practically best under the circumstances;
but her past history for generations had been
such as to make it out of the question for her
to bring forth such men as the founders of our
own government. Warriors, lawgivers, and
diplomats she had in abundance. Statesmen
who would be both hard-headed and true-hearted,
who would be wise and yet unselfish,
who would enact laws for a free people that
would make that people freer still, and yet hinder
them from doing wrong to their neighbors,&mdash;statesmen
of this order she neither had nor
could have had. Indeed, had there been such,
it may well be doubted if they could have
served France. With a people who made up in
fickle ferocity what they lacked in self-restraint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
and a king too timid and short-sighted to turn
any crisis to advantage, the French statesmen,
even had they been as wise as they were foolish,
would hardly have been able to arrest or alter
the march of events. Morris said bitterly that
France was the country where everything was
talked of, and where hardly anything was understood.</p>

<p>He told Lafayette that he thought the only
hope of the kingdom lay in a foreign war; it is
possible that the idea may have been suggested
to him by Lafayette's naive remark that he believed
his troops would readily follow him into
action, but that they would not mount guard
when it rained. Morris not only constantly
urged the French ministers to make war, but
actually drew up a plan of campaign for them.
He believed it would turn the popular ardor,
now constantly inflamed against the aristocrats,
into a new channel, and that "there was no
word perhaps in the dictionary which would
take the place of <i>aristocrat</i> so readily as <i>Anglais</i>."
In proof of the wisdom of his propositions
he stated, with absolute truthfulness:
"If Britain had declared war in 1774 against
the house of Bourbon, the now United States
would have bled freely in her cause." He was
disgusted with the littleness of the men who,
appalled at their own surroundings, and unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to make shift even for the moment, found themselves
thrown by chance to the helm, and face
to face with the wildest storm that had ever
shaken a civilized government. Speaking of
one of the new ministers, he remarked: "They
say he is a good kind of man, which is saying
very little;" and again, "You want just now
great men, to pursue great measures." Another
time, in advising a war,&mdash;a war of men, not of
money,&mdash;and speaking of the efforts made by
the neighboring powers against the revolutionists
in Flanders, he told his French friends that
they must either suffer for or with their allies;
and that the latter was at once the noblest and
the safest course.</p>

<p>In a letter to Washington he drew a picture
of the chaos as it really was, and at the same
time, with wonderful clear-sightedness, showed
the great good which the change was eventually
to bring to the mass of the people. Remembering
how bitter Morris's feelings were against
the revolutionists, it is extraordinary that they
did not blind him to the good that would in
the long run result from their movement. Not
another statesman would have been able to set
forth so clearly and temperately the benefits
that would finally come from the convulsions he
saw around him, although he rightly believed
that these benefits would be even greater could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the hideous excesses of the revolutionists be
forthwith stopped and punished.</p>

<p>His letter runs: "This unhappy country,
bewildered in the pursuit of metaphysical whimsies,
presents to our moral view a mighty ruin....
The sovereign, humbled to the level of a
beggar without pity, without resources, without
authority, without a friend. The Assembly, at
once a master and a slave, new in power, wild
in theory, raw in practice. It engrosses all functions,
though incapable of exercising any, and
has taken from this fierce, ferocious people every
restraint of religion and of respect." Where
this would all end, or what sum of misery
would be necessary to change the popular will
and awaken the popular heart, he could not say.
A glorious opportunity had been lost, and for
the time being the Revolution had failed. Yet,
he went on to say, in the consequences flowing
from it he was confident he could see the foundation
of future prosperity. For among these
consequences were,&mdash;1. The abolition of the different
rights and privileges which had formerly
kept the various provinces asunder; 2. The
abolition of feudal tyranny, by which the tenure
of real property would be simplified, and the
rent no longer be dependent upon idle vanity,
capricious taste, or sullen pride; 3. The throwing
into the circle of industry those vast possessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
formerly held by the clergy in mortmain,
wealth conferred upon them as wages for their
idleness; 4. The destruction of the system of
venal jurisprudence which had established the
pride and privileges of the few on the misery
and degradation of the general mass; 5. Above
all, the establishment of the principles of true
liberty, which would remain as solid facts after
the superstructure of metaphysical froth and
vapor should have been blown away. Finally,
"from the chaos of opinion and the conflict of
its jarring elements a new order will at length
arise, which, though in some degree the child of
chance, may not be less productive of human
happiness than the forethought provisions of
human speculation." Not one other contemporary
statesman could have begun to give so
just an estimate of the good the Revolution
would accomplish; no other could have seen so
deeply into its ultimate results, while also
keenly conscious of the dreadful evil through
which these results were being worked out.</p>

<p>The social life of Paris still went on, though
with ever less of gayety, as the gloom gathered
round about. Going with Madame de Chastellux
to dine with the Duchess of Orleans,
Morris was told by her royal highness that she
was "ruined," that is, that her income was
reduced from four hundred and fifty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
to two hundred thousand livres a year, so that
she could no longer give him good dinners; but
if he would come and fast with her, she would
be glad to see him. The poor lady was yet to
learn by bitter experience that real ruin was
something very different from the loss of half
of an enormous income.</p>

<p>On another occasion he breakfasted with the
duchess, and was introduced to her father, with
whom he agreed to dine. After breakfast she
went out walking with him till nearly dinner-time,
and gave him the full history of her breach
with her husband, Egalité, showing the letters
that had passed between them, complaining of
his numerous misdeeds, and assuring Morris
that what the world had attributed to fondness
for her worthless spouse was merely discretion;
that she had hoped to bring him to a decent
and orderly behavior, but had finally made up
her mind that he could only be governed by
fear.</p>

<p>Now and then he indulges in a quiet laugh
at the absurd pretensions and exaggerated estimates
of each other still affected by some of
the frequenters of the various salons. "Dine
with Madame de Staël. The Abbé Sieyès is
here, and descants with much self-sufficiency
on government, despising all that has been said
or sung on that subject before him; and madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
says that his writings and opinions will form
in politics a new era, like those of Newton in
physics."</p>

<p>After dining with Marmontel, he notes in his
Diary that his host "thinks soundly,"&mdash;rare
praise for him to bestow on any of the French
statesmen of the time. He records a <i>bon mot</i>
of Talleyrand's. When the Assembly had declared
war on the emperor conditionally upon
the latter's failing to beg pardon before a certain
date, the little bishop remarked that "the nation
was <i>une parvenue</i>, and of course insolent."
At the British ambassador's he met the famous
Colonel Tarleton, who did not know his nationality,
and amused him greatly by descanting at
length on the American war.</p>

<p>He was very fond of the theatre, especially
of the Comédie Française, where Préville, whom
he greatly admired, was acting in Molière's
"Amphitryon." Many of the plays, whose plots
presented in any way analogies to what was actually
happening in the political world, raised
great excitement among the spectators. Going
to see "Brutus" acted, he records that the noise
and altercations were tremendous, but that
finally the democrats in the parterre got the
upper hand by sheer lusty roaring, which they
kept up for a quarter of an hour at a time, and,
at the conclusion of the piece, insisted upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
bust of Voltaire being crowned and placed on
the stage. Soon afterwards a tragedy called
"Charles Neuf," founded on the massacre of St.
Bartholomew, was put on the stage, to help the
Assembly in their crusade against the clergy;
he deemed it a very extraordinary piece to be
represented in a Catholic country, and thought
that it would give a fatal blow to the Catholic
religion.</p>

<p>The priesthood, high and low, he disliked
more than any other set of men; all his comments
on them show his contempt. The high
prelates he especially objected to. The Bishop
of Orleans he considered to be a luxurious old
gentleman, "of the kind whose sincerest prayer
is for the fruit of good living, one who evidently
thought it more important to <i>speak</i> than to
speak the <i>truth</i>." The leader of the great church
dignitaries, in their fight for their rich benefices,
was the Abbé Maury, who, Morris writes, "is
a man who looks like a downright ecclesiastical
scoundrel." He met him in Madame de Nadaillac's
salon, where were "a party of fierce
aristocrats. They have the word 'valet' written
on their foreheads in large characters.
Maury is formed to govern such men, and they
are formed to obey him or any one else. But
Maury seems to have too much vanity for a
great man." To tell the bare truth is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
to make the most venomous comment
possible, and this he evidently felt when he
wrote of his meeting with the Cardinal de Rohan:
"We talk among other things about religion,
for the cardinal is very devout. He was
once the lover of Madame de Flahaut's sister."</p>

<p>But as the tremendous changes went on
about him, Morris had continually less and less
time to spend in mere social pleasures; graver
and weightier matters called for his attention,
and his Diary deals with the shifts and stratagems
of the French politicians, and pays little
heed to the sayings and manners of nobles,
bishops, and ladies of rank.</p>

<p>The talented, self-confident, fearless American,
admittedly out of sympathy with what he
called "this abominable populace," was now
well known; and in their terrible tangle of
dangers and perplexities, court and ministry
alike turned to him for help. Perhaps there
has hardly been another instance where, in such
a crisis, the rulers have clutched in their despair
at the advice of a mere private stranger sojourning
in the land on his own business. The
king and his ministers, as well as the queen,
kept in constant communication with him.
With Montmorin he dined continually, and
was consulted at every stage. But he could
not prevail on them to adopt the bold, vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
measures he deemed necessary; his plain speaking
startled them, and they feared it would not
suit the temper of the people. He drafted
numerous papers for them, among others a royal
speech, which the king liked, but which his
ministers prevented him from using. In fact,
it had grown to be hopeless to try to help the
court; for the latter pursued each course by
fits and starts, now governed by advice from
Coblentz, now by advice from Brussels, and
then for a brief spasm going its own gait. All
the while the people at large knew their own
minds no better than poor Louis knew his, and
cheered him with fervent ecstasy one day, only
to howl at him with malignant fury the next.
With such a monarch and such subjects it is
not probable that any plan would have worked
well; but Morris's was the ablest as well as
the boldest and best defined of the many that
were offered to the wretched, halting king; and
had his proposed policy been pursued, things
might have come out better, and they could not
possibly have come out worse.</p>

<p>All through these engrossing affairs, he kept
up the liveliest interest in what was going on
in his own country, writing home shrewd observations
on every step taken. One of his remarks
deserves to be kept in mind. In speaking
of the desire of European nations to legislate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
against the introduction of our produce,
he says that this effort has after all its bright
side; because it will force us "to make great
and rapid progress in useful manufactures. This
alone is wanting to complete our independence.
We shall then be, as it were, a world by ourselves."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>MINISTER TO FRANCE.</h3>

<p>In the spring of 1792, Morris received his
credentials as minister to France. There had
been determined opposition in the Senate to
the confirmation of his appointment, which was
finally carried only by a vote of sixteen to
eleven, mainly through the exertions of Rufus
King. His opponents urged the failure of the
British negotiations, the evidences repeatedly
given of his proud, impatient spirit, and above
all his hostility to the French Revolution, as
reasons why he should not be made minister.
Washington, however, as well as Hamilton,
King, and the other federalists, shared most of
Morris's views with regard to the Revolution,
and insisted upon his appointment.</p>

<p>But the president, as good and wise a friend as
Morris had, thought it best to send him a word
of warning, coupling with the statement of his
own unfaltering trust and regard, the reasons
why the new diplomat should observe more
circumspection than his enemies thought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
capable of showing. For his opponents asserted
that his brilliant, lively imagination always inclined
him to act so promptly as to leave no time
for cool judgment, and was, wrote Washington,
"the primary cause of those sallies which too
often offend, and of that ridicule of character
which begets enmity not easy to be forgotten,
but which might easily be avoided if it were
under the control of caution and prudence....
By reciting [their objections] I give you a
proof of my friendship, if I give none of my
policy."</p>

<p>Morris took his friend's advice in good part,
and profited by it as far as lay in his nature. He
knew that he had a task of stupendous difficulty
before him; as it would be almost impossible for
a minister to steer clear of the quarrels springing
from the ferocious hatred born to each other
by the royalists and the various republican factions.
To stand well with all parties he knew
was impossible: but he thought it possible, and
merely so, to stand <i>well</i> with the best people in
each, without greatly offending the others; and
in order to do this, he had to make up his mind
to mingle with the worst as well as the best, to
listen unmoved to falsehoods so foul and calumnies
so senseless as to seem the ravings of insanity;
and meanwhile to wear a front so firm
and yet so courteous as to ward off insult from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
his country and injury from himself during the
days when the whole people went crazy with
the blood-lust, when his friends were butchered
by scores around him, and when the rulers had
fulfiled Mirabeau's terrible prophecy, and had
"paved the streets with their bodies."</p>

<p>But when he began his duties, he was already
entangled in a most dangerous intrigue, one of
whose very existence he should not, as a foreign
minister, have known, still less have entered
into. He got enmeshed in it while still a
private citizen, and could not honorably withdraw,
for it dealt with nothing less than the
escape of the king and queen from Paris. His
chivalrous sympathy for the two hemmed-in,
hunted creatures, threatened by madmen and
counseled by fools, joined with his characteristic
impulsiveness and fearlessness, to incline
him to make an effort to save them from their
impending doom. A number of plans had been
made to get the king out of Paris; and as the
managers of each were of necessity ignorant of
all the rest, they clashed with and thwarted
one another. Morris's scheme was made in
concert with a M. de Monciel, one of the royal
ministers, and some other French gentlemen;
and their measures were so well taken that they
would doubtless have succeeded had not the
king's nerve invariably failed him at the critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
moment, and brought delay after delay. The
Swiss guards, faithful to their salt, were always
ready to cover his flight, and Lafayette would
have helped them.</p>

<p>Louis preferred Morris's plan to any of the
others offered, and gave a most striking proof
of his preference by sending to the latter, towards
the end of July, to say how much he
regretted that his advice had not been followed,
and to ask him if he would not take
charge of the royal papers and money. Morris
was unwilling to take the papers, but finally
consented to receive the money, amounting in
all to nearly seven hundred and fifty thousand
livres, which was to be paid out in hiring and
bribing the men who stood in the way of the
escape; for most of the revolutionists were as
venal as they were bloodthirsty. Still the
king lingered; then came the 10th of August;
the Swiss guards were slaughtered, and the
whole scheme was at an end. Some of the men
engaged in the plot were suspected; one, D'Angrémont,
was seized and condemned, but he
went to his death without betraying his fellows.
The others, by the liberal use of the money in
Morris's possession, were saved, the authorities
being bribed to wink at their escape or concealment.
Out of the money that was left advances
were made to Monciel and others; finally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
in 1796, Morris gave an accurate account of the
expenditures to the dead king's daughter, the
Duchesse d'Angoulême, then at the Austrian
court, and turned over to her the remainder,
consisting of a hundred and forty-seven pounds.</p>

<p>Of course all this was work in which no minister
had the least right to share; but the whole
crisis was one so completely without precedent
that it is impossible to blame Morris for what
he did. The extraordinary trust reposed in
him, and the feeling that his own exertions
were all that lay between the two unfortunate
sovereigns and their fate, roused his gallantry
and blinded him to the risk he himself ran, as
well as to the hazard to which he put his country's
interests. He was under no illusion as
to the character of the people whom he was
trying to serve. He utterly disapproved the
queen's conduct, and he despised the king, noting
the latter's feebleness and embarrassment,
even on the occasion of his presentation at
court; he saw in them "a lack of mettle which
would ever prevent them from being truly
royal"; but when in their mortal agony they
held out their hands to him for aid, his generous
nature forbade him to refuse it, nor could he
look on unmoved as they went helplessly down
to destruction.</p>

<p>The rest of his two years' history as minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
forms one of the most brilliant chapters in our
diplomatic annals. His boldness, and the frankness
with which he expressed his opinions,
though they at times irritated beyond measure
the factions of the revolutionists who successively
grasped a brief but tremendous power,
yet awed them, in spite of themselves. He soon
learned to combine courage and caution, and
his readiness, wit, and dash always gave him a
certain hold over the fiery nation to which he
was accredited. He was firm and dignified in
insisting on proper respect being shown our
flag, while he did all he could to hasten the
payment of our obligations to France. A very
large share of his time, also, was taken up with
protesting against the French decrees aimed
at neutral&mdash;which meant American&mdash;commerce,
and with interfering to save American
ship-masters, who had got into trouble by unwittingly
violating them. Like his successor,
Mr. Washburne, in the time of the commune,
Morris was the only foreign minister who remained
in Paris during the terror. He stayed
at the risk of his life; and yet, while fully
aware of his danger, he carried himself as coolly
as if in a time of profound peace, and never
flinched for a moment when he was obliged for
his country's sake to call to account the rulers of
France for the time being&mdash;men whose power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
was as absolute as it was ephemeral and bloody,
who had indulged their desire for slaughter
with the unchecked ferocity of madmen, and
who could by a word have had him slain as
thousands had been slain before him. Few
foreign ministers have faced such difficulties,
and not one has ever come near to facing such
dangers as Morris did during his two years'
term of service. His feat stands by itself in
diplomatic history; and, as a minor incident,
the letters and despatches he sent home give
a very striking view of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>As soon as he was appointed he went to see
the French minister of foreign affairs; and in
answer to an observation of the latter stated
with his customary straightforwardness that it
was true that, while a mere private individual,
sincerely friendly to France, and desirous of
helping her, and whose own nation could not
be compromised by his acts, he had freely taken
part in passing events, had criticised the constitution,
and advised the king and his ministers;
but he added that, now that he was a public
man, he would no longer meddle with their
affairs. To this resolution he kept, save that,
as already described, sheer humanity induced
him to make an effort to save the king's life.
He had predicted what would ensue as the result
of the exaggerated decentralization into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
which the opponents of absolutism had rushed;
when they had split the state up into more than
forty thousand sovereignties, each district the
sole executor of the law, and the only judge of
its propriety, and therefore obedient to it only
so long as it listed, and until rendered hostile by
the ignorant whim or ferocious impulse of the
moment; and now he was to see his predictions
come true. In that brilliant and able state
paper, the address he had drawn up for Louis to
deliver when, in 1791, the latter accepted the
constitution, the key-note of the situation was
struck in the opening words: "It is no longer a
king who addresses you, Louis XVI. is a private
individual"; and he had then scored off, point
by point, the faults in a document that created
an unwieldy assembly of men unaccustomed to
govern, that destroyed the principle of authority,
though no other could appeal to a people
helpless in their new-born liberty, and that
created out of one whole a jarring multitude of
fractional sovereignties. Now he was to see
one of these same sovereignties rise up in successful
rebellion against the government that
represented the whole, destroy it and usurp its
power, and establish over all France the rule
of an anarchic despotism which, by what seems
to a free American a gross misnomer, they
called a democracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
All through June, at the beginning of which
month Morris had been formally presented at
court, the excitement and tumult kept increasing.
When, on the 20th, the mob forced the
gates of the chateau, and made the king put
on the red cap, Morris wrote in his Diary that
the constitution had given its last groan. A
few days afterwards he told Lafayette that in
six weeks everything would be over, and tried
to persuade him that his only chance was to
make up his mind instantly to fight either for
a good constitution or for the wretched piece
of paper which bore the name. Just six weeks
to a day from the date of this prediction came
the 10th of August to verify it.</p>

<p>Throughout July the fevered pulses of the
people beat with always greater heat. Looking
at the maddened mob the American minister
thanked God from his heart that in his own
country there was no such populace, and prayed
with unwonted earnestness that our education
and morality should forever stave off such an
evil. At court even the most purblind dimly
saw their doom. Calling there one morning
he chronicles with a matter of fact brevity, impressive
from its very baldness, that nothing of
note had occurred except that they had stayed
up all night expecting to be murdered. He
wrote home that he could not tell "whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
king would live through the storm; for it blew
hard."</p>

<p>His horror of the base mob, composed of people
whose kind was absolutely unknown in
America, increased continually, as he saw them
going on from crimes that were great to crimes
that were greater, incited by the demagogues
who flattered them and roused their passions
and appetites; and blindly raging because they
were of necessity disappointed in the golden
prospects held out to them. He scorned the
folly of the enthusiasts and doctrinaires who
had made a constitution all sail and no ballast,
that overset at the first gust; who had freed
from all restraint a mass of men as savage and
licentious as they were wayward; who had put
the executive in the power of the legislature,
and this latter at the mercy of the leaders who
could most strongly influence and inflame the
mob. But his contempt for the victims almost
exceeded his anger at their assailants. The
king, who could suffer with firmness, and who
could act either not at all, or else with the
worst possible effect, had the head and heart
that might have suited the monkish idea of a
female saint, but which were hopelessly out of
place in any rational being supposed to be fitted
for doing good in the world. Morris wrote
home that he knew his friend Hamilton had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
particular aversion to kings, and would not believe
them to be tigers; but that if Hamilton
came to Europe to see for himself, he would
surely believe them to be monkeys; the Empress
of Russia was the only reigning sovereign
whose talents were not "considerably below
par." At the moment of the final shock the
court was involved in a set of paltry intrigues
"unworthy of anything above the rank of a
footman or a chambermaid. Every one had his
or her little project, and every little project had
some abettors. Strong, manly counsels frightened
the weak, alarmed the envious, and
wounded the enervated minds of the lazy and
luxurious." The few such counsels that appeared
were always approved, rarely adopted,
and never followed out.</p>

<p>Then in the sweltering heat of August, the
end came. A raving, furious horde stormed
the chateau, and murdered, one by one, the
brave mountaineers who gave their lives for a
sovereign too weak to be worthy of such gallant
bloodshed. King and queen fled to the
National Assembly, and the monarchy was
over. Immediately after the awful catastrophe
Morris wrote to a friend: "The voracity of the
court, the haughtiness of the nobles, the sensuality
of the church, have met their punishment
in the road of their transgressions. The oppressor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
has been squeezed by the hands of the
oppressed; but there remains yet to be acted
an awful scene in this great tragedy, played on
the theatre of the universe for the instruction
of mankind."</p>

<p>Not the less did he dare everything, and
jeopardize his own life in trying to save some
at least among the innocent who had been overthrown
in the crash of the common ruin. When
on the 10th of August the whole city lay abject
at the mercy of the mob, hunted men and
women, bereft of all they had, and fleeing from
a terrible death, with no hiding-place, no friend
who could shield them, turned in their terror-struck
despair to the one man in whose fearlessness
and generous gallantry they could trust.
The shelter of Morris's house and flag was
sought from early morning till past midnight
by people who had nowhere else to go and who
felt that within his walls they were sure of at
least a brief safety from the maddened savages
in the streets. As far as possible they
were sent off to places of greater security; but
some had to stay with him till the storm lulled
for a moment. An American gentleman who
was in Paris on that memorable day, after viewing
the sack of the Tuileries, thought it right
to go to the house of the American minister.
He found him surrounded by a score of people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of both sexes, among them the old Count
d'Estaing, and other men of note, who had
fought side by side with us in our war for independence,
and whom now our flag protected
in their hour of direst need. Silence reigned,
only broken occasionally by the weeping of the
women and children. As his visitor was leaving,
Morris took him to one side, and told him
that he had no doubt there were persons on the
watch who would find fault with his conduct
as a minister in receiving and protecting these
people; that they had come of their own accord,
uninvited. "Whether my house will be a protection
to them or to me, God only knows; but
I will not turn them out of it, let what will happen
to me; you see, sir, they are all persons to
whom our country is more or less indebted, and
had they no such claim upon me, it would be
inhuman to force them into the hands of the
assassins." No one of Morris's countrymen
can read his words even now without feeling a
throb of pride in the dead statesman, who, a
century ago, held up so high the honor of his
nation's name in the times when the souls of
all but the very bravest were tried and found
wanting.</p>

<p>Soon after this he ceased writing in his Diary,
for fear it might fall into the hands of men who
would use it to incriminate his friends; and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the same reason he had also to be rather wary
in what he wrote home, as his letters frequently
bore marks of being opened, thanks to
what he laughingly called "patriotic curiosity."
He was, however, perfectly fearless as regards
any ill that might befall himself; his circumspection
was only exercised on behalf of others,
and his own opinions were given as frankly as
ever.</p>

<p>He pictured the French as huddled together,
in an unreasoning panic, like cattle before a
thunderstorm. Their every act increased his
distrust of their capacity for self-government.
They were for the time agog with their republic,
and ready to adopt any form of government
with a huzza; but that they would adopt
a good form, or, having adopted it, keep it, he
did not believe; and he saw that the great
mass of the population were already veering
round, under the pressure of accumulating
horrors, until they would soon be ready to welcome
as a blessing even a despotism, if so they
could gain security to life and property. They
had made the common mistake of believing
that to enjoy liberty they had only to abolish authority;
and the equally common consequence
was, that they were now, through anarchy, on
the high road to absolutism. Said Morris:
"Since I have been in this country I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the worship of many idols, and but little of the
true God. I have seen many of these idols
broken, and some of them beaten to the dust.
I have seen the late constitution in one short
year admired as a stupendous monument of human
wisdom, and ridiculed as an egregious production
of folly and vice. I wish much, very
much, the happiness of this inconstant people.
I love them, I feel grateful for their efforts in
our cause, and I consider the establishment of
a good constitution here as the principal means,
under Divine Providence, of extending the
blessings of freedom to the many millions of
my fellow-men who groan in bondage on the
continent of Europe. But I do not greatly indulge
the flattering illusions of hope, because I
do not yet perceive that reformation of morals
without which liberty is but an empty sound."
These words are such as could only come from
a genuine friend of France, and champion of
freedom; from a strong, earnest man, saddened
by the follies of dreamers, and roused to stern
anger by the licentious wickedness of scoundrels
who used the name of liberty to cloak the
worst abuses of its substance.</p>

<p>His stay in Paris was now melancholy indeed.
The city was shrouded in a gloom only relieved
by the frenzied tumults that grew steadily more
numerous. The ferocious craving once roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
could not be sated; the thirst grew ever stronger
as the draughts were deeper. The danger to
Morris's own person merely quickened his
pulses, and roused his strong, brave nature; he
liked excitement, and the strain that would
have been too tense for weaker nerves keyed
his own up to a fierce, half-exultant thrilling.
But the woes that befell those who had befriended
him caused him the keenest grief. It
was almost unbearable to be seated quietly at
dinner, and hear by accident "that a friend
was on his way to the place of execution," and
to have to sit still and wonder which of the
guests dining with him would be the next to go
to the scaffold. The vilest criminals swarmed
in the streets, and amused themselves by tearing
the earrings from women's ears, and snatching
away their watches. When the priests
shut up in the <i>carnes</i>, and the prisoners in the
<i>abbaie</i> were murdered, the slaughter went on
all day, and eight hundred men were engaged
in it.</p>

<p>He wrote home that, to give a true picture
of France, he would have to paint it like an
Indian warrior, black and red. The scenes
that passed were literally beyond the imagination
of the American mind. The most hideous
and nameless atrocities were so common as to
be only alluded to incidentally, and to be recited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
in the most matter-of-fact way in connection
with other events. For instance, a man
applied to the Convention for a recompense for
damage done to his quarry, a pit dug deep
through the surface of the earth into the stone
bed beneath: the damage consisted in such a
number of dead bodies having been thrown into
the pit as to choke it up so that he could no
longer get men to work it. Hundreds, who had
been the first in the land, were thus destroyed
without form or trial, and their bodies thrown
like dead dogs into the first hole that offered.
Two hundred priests were killed for no other
crime than having been conscientiously scrupulous
about taking the prescribed oath. The
guillotine went smartly on, watched with a
devilish merriment by the fiends who were
themselves to perish by the instrument their
own hands had wrought. "Heaven only knew
who was next to drink of the dreadful cup; as
far as man could tell, there was to be no lack
of liquor for some time to come."</p>

<p>Among the new men who, one after another,
sprang into the light, to maintain their unsteady
footing as leaders for but a brief time before
toppling into the dark abyss of death or oblivion
that waited for each and all, Dumouriez was for
the moment the most prominent. He stood
towards the Gironde much as Lafayette had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
stood towards the Constitutionalists of 1789:
he led the army, as Lafayette once had led it;
and as the constitutional monarchists had fallen
before his fellow-republicans, so both he and
they were to go down before the even wilder
extremists of the "Mountain." For the factions
in Paris, face to face with the banded might of
the European monarchies, and grappling in a
grim death-struggle with the counter-revolutionists
of the provinces, yet fought one another
with the same ferocity they showed towards the
common foe. Nevertheless, success was theirs;
for against opponents only less wicked than
themselves they moved with an infinitely superior
fire and enthusiasm. Reeking with the
blood of the guiltless, steeped in it to the lips,
branded with fresh memories of crimes and infamies
without number, and yet feeling in their
very marrow that they were avenging centuries
of grinding and intolerable thralldom, and that
the cause for which they fought was just and
righteous; with shameless cruelty and corruption
eating into their hearts' core, yet with their
foreheads kindled by the light of a glorious
morning,&mdash;they moved with a ruthless energy
that paralyzed their opponents, the worn-out,
tottering, crazy despotisms, rotten with vice,
despicable in their ludicrous pride of caste,
moribund in their military pedantry, and fore-doomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
to perish in the conflict they had
courted. The days of Danton and Robespierre
are not days to which a French patriot cares to
look back; but at any rate he can regard them
without the shame he must feel when he thinks
of the times of Louis Quinze. Danton and his
like, at least, were men, and stood far, far above
the palsied coward&mdash;a eunuch in his lack of all
virile virtues&mdash;who misruled France for half
a century; who, with his followers, indulged
in every crime and selfish vice known, save
only such as needed a particle of strength, or
the least courage, in the committing.</p>

<p>Morris first met Dumouriez when the latter
was minister of foreign affairs, shortly before
the poor king was driven from the Tuileries.
He dined with him, and afterwards noted down
that the society was noisy and in bad style;
for the grace and charm of French social life
were gone, and the raw republicans were ill at
ease in the drawing-room. At this time Morris
commented often on the change in the look
of Paris: all his gay friends gone; the city
sombre and uneasy. When he walked through
the streets, in the stifling air of a summer hot
beyond precedent, as if the elements sympathized
with the passions of men, he met, instead
of the brilliant company of former days, only
the few peaceable citizens left, hurrying on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
ways with frightened watchfulness; or else
groups of lolling ruffians, with sinister eyes and
brutalized faces; or he saw in the Champs de
Mars squalid ragamuffins signing the petition
for the <i>déchéance</i>.</p>

<p>Morris wrote Washington that Dumouriez
was a bold, determined man, bitterly hostile to
the Jacobins and all the extreme revolutionary
clubs, and, once he was in power, willing to
risk his own life in the effort to put them down.
However, the hour of the Jacobins had not yet
struck, and the Revolution had now been permitted
to gather such headway that it could be
stopped only by a master genius; and Dumouriez
was none such.</p>

<p>Still he was an able man, and, as Morris
wrote home, in his military operations he combined
the bravery of a skilled soldier and the
arts of an astute politician. To be sure, his
victories were not in themselves very noteworthy;
the artillery skirmish at Valmy was
decided by the reluctance of the Germans to
come on, not by the ability of the French to
withstand them; and at Jemappes the imperialists
were hopelessly outnumbered. Still the
results were most important, and Dumouriez
overran Flanders in the face of hostile Europe.
He at once proceeded to revolutionize the government
of his conquest in the most approved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
French fashion, which was that all the neighbors
of France should receive liberty whether
or no, and should moreover pay the expense
of having it thrust upon them: accordingly he
issued a proclamation to his new fellow-citizens,
"which might be summed up in a few words as
being an order to them to be free forthwith,
according to his ideas of freedom, on pain of
military execution."</p>

<p>He had things all his own way for the moment,
but after a while he was defeated by the
Germans; then while the Gironde tottered to
its fall, he fled to the very foes he had been
fighting, as the only way of escaping death from
the men whose favorite he had been. Morris
laughed bitterly at the fickle people. One anecdote
he gives is worth preserving: "It is a
year ago that a person who mixed in tumults to
see what was doing, told me of a <i>sans culottes</i>
who, bellowing against poor Lafayette, when
Petion appeared, changed at once his note to
'<i>Vive Petion!</i>' and then, turning round to one
of his companions, 'Vois tu! C'est notre ami,
n'est ce pas? Eh bien, il passera comme les
autres.' And, lo! the prophecy is fulfilled; and
I this instant learn that Petion, confined to his
room as a traitor or conspirator, has fled, on the
24th of June, 1793, from those whom he sent,
on the 20th of June, 1792, to assault the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
in the Tuileries. In short you will find, in the
list of those who were ordered by their brethren
to be arrested, the names of those who have
proclaimed themselves to be the prime movers
of the revolution of the 10th of August, and the
fathers of the republic."</p>

<p>About the time the <i>sans culottes</i> had thus
bellowed against Lafayette, the latter met Morris,
for the first time since he was presented at
court as minister, and at once spoke to him in
his tone of ancient familiarity. The Frenchman
had been brought at last to realize the
truth of his American friend's theories and predictions.
It was much too late to save himself,
however. After the 10th of August he was
proclaimed by the Assembly, found his troops
falling away from him, and fled over the frontier;
only to be thrown into prison by the allied
monarchs, who acted with their usual folly and
baseness. Morris, contemptuously impatient of
the part he had played, wrote of him: "Thus
his circle is completed. He has spent his fortune
on a revolution, and is now crushed by the
wheel which he put in motion. He lasted longer
than I expected." But this momentary indignation
soon gave way to a generous sympathy
for the man who had served America so well,
and who, if without the great abilities necessary
to grapple with the tumult of French affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
had yet always acted with such unselfish purity
of motive. Lafayette, as soon as he was imprisoned,
wrote to the American minister in Holland,
alleging that he had surrendered his position
as a French subject, and was now an
American citizen, and requesting the American
representatives in Europe to procure his release.
His claim was of course untenable; and, though
the American government did all it could on his
behalf through its foreign ministers, and though
Washington himself wrote a strong letter of
appeal to the Austrian emperor, he remained
in prison until the peace, several years later.</p>

<p>All Lafayette's fortune was gone, and while
in prison he was reduced to want. As soon
as Morris heard this, he had the sum of ten
thousand florins forwarded to the prisoner by
the United States bankers at Amsterdam;
pledging his own security for the amount, which
was, however, finally allowed by the government
under the name of compensation for Lafayette's
military services in America. Morris
was even more active in befriending Madame
de Lafayette and her children. To the former
he lent from his own private funds a hundred
thousand livres, enabling her to pay her debts
to the many poor people who had rendered services
to her family. To the proud, sensitive
lady the relief was great, much though it hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
her to be under any obligation: she wrote to her
friend that he had broken the chains that loaded
her down, and had done it in a way that made
her feel the consolation, rather than the weight,
of the obligation. But he was to do still more
for her; for, when she was cast into prison by
the savage Parisian mob, his active influence
on her behalf saved her from death. In a letter
to him, written some time later, she says,
after speaking of the money she had borrowed:
"This is a slight obligation, it is true, compared
with that of my life, but allow me to remember
both while life lasts, with a sentiment of gratitude
which it is precious to feel."</p>

<p>There were others whose fortunes turned with
the wheel of fate, for whom Morris felt no such
sympathy as for the Lafayettes. Among the
number was the Duke of Orleans, now transformed
into <i>citoyen Egalité</i>. Morris credited
this graceless debauchee with criminal ambitions
which he probably did not possess, saying
that he doubted the public virtue of a profligate,
and could not help distrusting such a
man's pretensions; nor is it likely that he regretted
much the fate of the man who died
under the same guillotine which, with his assent,
had fallen on the neck of the king, his
cousin.</p>

<p>It needed no small amount of hardihood for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
a man of Morris's prominence and avowed sentiments
to stay in Paris when Death was mowing
round him with a swath at once so broad and
so irregular. The power was passing rapidly
from hand to hand, through a succession of men
fairly crazy in their indifference to bloodshed.
Not a single other minister of a neutral nation
dared stay. In fact, the foreign representatives
were preparing to go away even before the final
stroke was given to the monarchy, and soon
after the 10th of August the entire <i>corps diplomatique</i>
left Paris as rapidly as the various
members could get their passports. These the
new republican government was at first very
reluctant to grant; indeed, when the Venetian
ambassador started off he was very ignominiously
treated and brought back. Morris went
to the British ambassador's to take leave, having
received much kindness from him, and having
been very intimate in his house. He found
Lord Gower in a tearing passion because he
could not get passports; he had burned his
papers, and strongly advised his guest to do
likewise. On this advice the latter refused to
act, nor would he take the broad hints given
him to the effect that honor required him to
quit the country. Morris could not help showing
his amusement at the fear and anger exhibited
at the ambassador's, "which exhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
spirits his lordship could hardly bear." Talleyrand,
who was getting his own passport, also
did all in his power to persuade the American
minister to leave, but without avail. Morris
was not a man to be easily shaken in any determination
he had taken after careful thought.
He wrote back to Jefferson that his opinion
was directly opposed to the views of such people
as had tried to persuade him that his own
honor, and that of America, required him to
leave France; and that he was inclined to attribute
such counsel mainly to fear. It was
true that the position was not without danger;
but he presumed that, when the president named
him to the embassy, it was not for his own personal
pleasure or safety, but for the interests of
the country; and these he could certainly serve
best by staying.</p>

<p>He was able to hold his own only by a mixture
of tact and firmness. Any signs of flinching
would have ruined him outright. He would
submit to no insolence. The minister of foreign
affairs was, with his colleagues, engaged in
certain schemes in reference to the American
debt, which were designed to further their own
private interests; he tried to bully Morris into
acquiescence, and, on the latter's point-blank
refusal, sent him a most insulting letter. Morris
promptly retorted by demanding his passports.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
France, however, was very desirous not
to break with the United States, the only friend
she had left in the world; and the offending
minister sent a sullen letter of apology, asking
him to reconsider his intention to leave,
and offering entire satisfaction for every point
of which he complained. Accordingly Morris
stayed.</p>

<p>He was, however, continually exposed to insults
and worries, which were always apologized
for by the government for the time being, on
the ground, no doubt true, that in such a period
of convulsions it was impossible to control their
subordinate agents. Indeed, the changes from
one form of anarchy to another went on so
rapidly that the laws of nations had small
chance of observance.</p>

<p>One evening a number of people, headed by
a commissary of the section, entered his house,
and demanded to search it for arms said to be
hidden therein. Morris took a high tone, and
was very peremptory with them; told them
that they should not examine his house, that it
held no arms, and moreover that, if he had possessed
any, they should not touch one of them;
he also demanded the name of "the blockhead
or rascal" who had informed against him, announcing
his intention to bring him to punishment.
Finally he got them out of the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
and the next morning the commissary called
with many apologies, which were accepted.</p>

<p>Another time he was arrested in the street
for not having a <i>carte de citoyen</i>, but he was
released as soon as it was found out who he was.
Again he was arrested while traveling in the
country, on the pretence that his passport was
out of date; an insult for which the government
at once made what amends they could. His
house was also visited another time by armed
men, whom, as before, he persuaded to go away.
Once or twice, in the popular tumults, even his
life was in danger; on one occasion it is said
that it was only saved by the fact of his having
a wooden leg, which made him known to the
mob as "a cripple of the American war for
freedom." Rumors even got abroad in England
and America that he had been assassinated.</p>

<p>Morris's duties were manifold, and as harassing
to himself as they were beneficial to his
country. Sometimes he would interfere on behalf
of America as a whole, and endeavor to
get obnoxious decrees of the Assembly repealed;
and again he would try to save some private
citizen of the United States who had got himself
into difficulties. Reports of the French
minister of foreign affairs, as well as reports of
the <i>comité de salut public</i>, alike bear testimony
to the success of his endeavors, whenever success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
was possible, and unconsciously show the
value of the services he rendered to his country.
Of course it was often impossible to obtain complete
redress, because, as Morris wrote home,
the government, while all-powerful in certain
cases, was in others not merely feeble, but enslaved,
and was often obliged to commit acts the
consequences of which the nominal leaders both
saw and lamented. Morris also, while doing
all he could for his fellow-citizens, was often
obliged to choose between their interests and
those of the nation at large; and he of course
decided in favor of the latter, though well
aware of the clamor that was certain to be
raised against him in consequence by those
who, as he caustically remarked, found it the
easiest thing in the world to get anything they
wanted from the French government <i>until they
had tried</i>.</p>

<p>One of his most important transactions was
in reference to paying off the debt due by
America for amounts loaned her during the
war for independence. The interest and a part
of the principal had already been paid. At
the time when Morris was made minister, the
United States had a large sum of money, destined
for the payment of the public debt, lying
idle in the hands of the bankers at Amsterdam;
and this sum both Morris and the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
minister to Holland, Mr. Short, thought could
be well applied to the payment of part of our
remaining obligation to France. The French
government was consulted, and agreed to receive
the sum; but hardly was the agreement entered
into before the monarchy was overturned.
The question at once arose as to whether the
money could be rightfully paid over to the men
who had put themselves at the head of affairs,
and who, a month hence, might themselves be
ousted by others who would not acknowledge
the validity of a payment made to them. Short
thought the payment should be stopped, and, as
it afterwards turned out, the home authorities
agreed with him. But Morris thought otherwise,
and paid over the amount. Events fully
justified his course, for France never made
any difficulty in the matter, and even had she
done so, as Morris remarked, America had the
staff in her own hands, and could walk which
way she pleased, for she owed more money, and
in the final adjustment could insist on the
amount paid being allowed on account of the
debt.</p>

<p>The French executive council owed Morris
gratitude for his course in this matter; but they
became intensely irritated with him shortly
afterwards because he refused to fall in with
certain proposals they made to him as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
manner of applying part of the debt to the purchase
of provisions and munitions for San Domingo.
Morris had good reason to believe that
there was a private speculation at the bottom of
this proposal, and declined to accede to it. The
urgency with which it was made, and the wrath
which his course excited, confirmed his suspicions,
and he persisted in his refusal although
it almost brought about a break with the men
then carrying on the government. Afterwards,
when these men fell with the Gironde, he
wrote home: "I mentioned to you the plan
of a speculation on drafts to have been made
on the United States, could my concurrence
have been procured. Events have shown that
this speculation would have been a good one to
the parties, who would have gained (and the
French nation of course have lost) about fifty
thousand pounds sterling in eighty thousand.
I was informed at that time that the disappointed
parties would attempt to have me
recalled, and some more tractable character
sent, who would have the good sense to look
after his own interest. Well, sir, nine months
have elapsed, and now, if I were capable of
such things, I think it would be no difficult
matter to have some of them hanged; indeed
it is highly probable that they will experience
a fate of that sort."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Much of his time was also taken up in remonstrating
against the attacks of French
privateers on American shipping. These, however,
went steadily on until, half a dozen years
afterwards, we took the matter into our own
hands, and in the West Indies inflicted a smart
drubbing, not only on the privateers of France,
but on her regular men-of-war as well. He
also did what he could for the French officers
who had served in America during the War of
Independence, most of whom were forced to flee
from France after the outbreak of the Revolution.</p>

<p>His letters home, even after his regular duties
had begun to be engrossing, contained a
running commentary on the events that were
passing around him. His forecasts of events
within France were remarkably shrewd, and
he displayed a wonderful insight into the motives
and characters of the various leaders;
but at first he was all at sea in his estimate
of the military situation, being much more at
home among statesmen than soldiers. He had
expected the allied sovereigns to make short
work of the raw republican armies, and was
amazed at the success of the latter. But he
very soon realized how the situation stood;
that whereas the Austrian and Prussian troops
simply came on in well-drilled, reluctant obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
to their commanding officers, the soldiers
of France, on the contrary, were actuated by a
fiery spirit the like of which had hardly been
seen since the crusades. The bitterness of
the contest was appalling, and so was the way
in which the ranks of the contestants were
thinned out. The extreme republicans believed
in their creed with a furious faith; and they
were joined by their fellow-citizens with an
almost equal zeal, when once it had become
evident that the invaders were hostile not only
to the Republic but to France itself, and very
possibly meditated its dismemberment.</p>

<p>When the royal and imperial forces invaded
France in 1792, they threatened such ferocious
vengeance as to excite the most desperate resistance,
and yet they backed up their high sounding
words by deeds so faulty, weak, and slow
as to make themselves objects of contempt
rather than dread. The Duke of Brunswick
in particular, as a prelude to some very harmless
military man&#339;uvres, issued a singularly
lurid and foolish manifesto, announcing that he
would deliver up Paris to utter destruction and
would give over all the soldiers he captured to
military execution. Morris said that his address
was in substance, "Be all against me,
for I am opposed to you all, and make a good
resistance, for there is no longer any hope;" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
added that it would have been wiser to have begun
with some great success and then to have
carried the danger near those whom it was desired
to intimidate. As it was, the Duke's campaign
failed ignominiously, and all the invaders
were driven back, for France rose as one
man, her warriors overflowed on every side,
and bore down all her foes by sheer weight
of numbers and impetuous enthusiasm. Her
government was a despotism as well as an anarchy;
it was as totally free from the drawbacks
as from the advantages of the democratic
system that it professed to embody.
Nothing could exceed the merciless energy of
the measures adopted. Half-way wickedness
might have failed; but a wholesale murder of
the disaffected, together with a confiscation of
all the goods of the rich, and a vigorous conscription
of the poor for soldiers, secured success,
at least for the time being. The French
made it a war of men; so that the price of labor
rose enormously at once, and the condition of
the working classes forthwith changed greatly
for the better&mdash;one good result of the Revolution,
at any rate.</p>

<p>Morris wrote home very soon after the 10th
of August that the then triumphant revolutionists,
the Girondists or party of Brissot, who had
supplanted the moderate party of Lafayette exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
as the latter had succeeded the aristocracy,
would soon in their turn be overthrown
by men even more extreme and even more
bloodthirsty; and that thus it would go on,
wave after wave, until at last the wizard arose
who could still them. By the end of the year
the storm had brewed long enough to be near
the bursting point. One of the promoters of
the last outbreak, now himself marked as a
victim, told Morris that he personally would die
hard, but that most of his colleagues, though
like him doomed to destruction, and though so
fierce in dealing with the moderate men, now
showed neither the nerve nor hardihood that
alone could stave off the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king, as Morris wrote home,
showed in his death a better spirit than his
life had promised; for he died in a manner
becoming his dignity, with calm courage, praying
that his foes might be forgiven and his
deluded people be benefited by his death,&mdash;his
words from the scaffold being drowned by the
drums of Santerre. As a whole, the Gironde
had opposed putting the king to death, and
thus capping the structure whose foundations
they had laid; they held back all too late.
The fabric of their system was erected on a
quagmire, and it now settled down and crushed
the men who had built it. "All people of morality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
and intelligence had long agreed that as yet
republican virtues were not of Gallic growth;"
and so the power slipped naturally into the
grasp of the lowest and most violent, of those
who were loudest to claim the possession of
republican principles, while in practice showing
that they had not even the dimmest idea
of what such principles meant.</p>

<p>The leaders were quite at the mercy of the
gusts of fierce passion that swayed the breasts
of their brutal followers. Morris wrote home
that the nominal rulers, or rather the few by
whom these rulers were directed, had finally
gained very just ideas of the value of popular
opinion; but that they were not in a condition
to act according to their knowledge; and that if
they were able to reach harbor there would be
quite as much of good luck as of good management
about it, and, at any rate, a part of the
crew would have to be thrown overboard.</p>

<p>Then the Mountain rose under Danton and
Marat, and the party of the Gironde was entirely
put down. The leaders were cast into
prison, with the certainty before their eyes that
the first great misfortune to France would call
them from their dungeons to act as expiatory
victims. The Jacobins ruled supreme, and under
them the government became a despotism
in principle as well as in practice. Part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Convention arrested the rest; and the revolutionary
tribunals ruled red-handed, with a
whimsical and ferocious tyranny. Said Morris:
"It is an emphatical phrase among the patriots
that <i>terror is the order of the day</i>; some years
have elapsed since Montesquieu wrote that the
principle of arbitrary governments is <i>fear</i>."
The prisons were choked with <i>suspects</i>, and
blood flowed more freely than ever. Terror had
reached its highest point. Danton was soon to
fall before Robespierre. Among a host of other
victims the queen died, with a brave dignity
that made people half forget her manifold
faults; and Philippe Egalité, the dissolute and
unprincipled scoundrel, after a life than which
none could be meaner and more unworthy, now
at the end went to his death with calm and
unflinching courage.</p>

<p>One man had a very narrow escape. This
was Thomas Paine, the Englishman, who had
at one period rendered such a striking service
to the cause of American independence,
while the rest of his life had been as ignoble as
it was varied. He had been elected to the Convention,
and, having sided with the Gironde, was
thrown into prison by the Jacobins. He at
once asked Morris to demand him as an American
citizen; a title to which he of course had
no claim. Morris refused to interfere too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
actively, judging rightly that Paine would be
saved by his own insignificance and would serve
his own interests best by keeping still. So the
filthy little atheist had to stay in prison,
"where he amused himself with publishing a
pamphlet against Jesus Christ." There are
infidels and infidels; Paine belonged to the variety&mdash;whereof
America possesses at present
one or two shining examples&mdash;that apparently
esteems a bladder of dirty water as the proper
weapon with which to assail Christianity. It
is not a type that appeals to the sympathy of
an onlooker, be said onlooker religious or otherwise.</p>

<p>Morris never paid so much heed to the military
events as to the progress of opinion in
France, believing "that such a great country
must depend more upon interior sentiment than
exterior operations." He took a half melancholy,
half sardonic interest in the overthrow of
the Catholic religion by the revolutionists; who
had assailed it with the true French weapon,
ridicule, but ridicule of a very grim and unpleasant
kind. The people who five years before
had fallen down in the dirt as the consecrated
matter passed by, now danced the carmagnole
in holy vestments, and took part in
some other mummeries a great deal more
blasphemous. At the famous Feast of Reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
which Morris described as a kind of opera
performed in Notre Dame, the president of the
Convention, and other public characters, adored
on bended knees a girl who stood in the place
<i>ci-devant</i> most holy to personate Reason herself.
This girl, Saunier by name, followed the
trades of an opera dancer and harlot; she was
"very beautiful and next door to an idiot as to
her intellectual gifts." Among her feats was
having appeared in a ballet in a dress especially
designed, by the painter David, at her bidding,
to be more indecent than nakedness. Altogether
she was admirably fitted, both morally
and mentally, to personify the kind of reason
shown and admired by the French revolutionists.</p>

<p>Writing to a friend who was especially hostile
to Romanism, Morris once remarked, with
the humor that tinged even his most serious
thoughts, "Every day of my life gives me reason
to question my own infallibility; and of
course leads me further from confiding in that
of the pope. But I have lived to see a new religion
arise. It consists in a denial of all religion,
and its votaries have the superstition of
not being superstitious. They have this with
as much zeal as any other sect, and are as
ready to lay waste the world in order to make
proselytes." Another time, speaking of his country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
place at Sainport, to which he had retired
from Paris, he wrote: "We are so scorched by
a long drought that in spite of all philosophic
notions we are beginning our procession to obtain
the favor of the <i>bon dieu</i>. Were it proper
for <i>un homme public et protestant</i> to interfere, I
should be tempted to tell them that mercy is
before sacrifice." Those individuals of arrested
mental development who now make pilgrimages
to our Lady of Lourdes had plenty of
prototypes, even in the atheistical France of
the Revolution.</p>

<p>In his letters home Morris occasionally made
clear-headed comments on American affairs.
He considered that "we should be unwise in the
extreme to involve ourselves in the contests of
European nations, where our weight could be
but small, though the loss to ourselves would
be certain. We ought to be extremely watchful
of foreign affairs, but there is a broad line
between vigilance and activity." Both France
and England had violated their treaties with
us; but the latter "had behaved worst, and with
deliberate intention." He especially laid stress
upon the need of our having a navy; "with
twenty ships of the line at sea no nation on
earth will dare to insult us;" even aside from
individual losses, five years of war would involve
more national expense than the support of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
navy for twenty years, and until we rendered
ourselves respectable, we should continue to be
insulted. He never showed greater wisdom
than in his views about our navy; and his party,
the federalists, started to give us one; but it
had hardly been begun before the Jeffersonians
came into power, and, with singular foolishness,
stopped the work.</p>

<p>Washington heartily sympathized with Morris's
views as to the French Revolution; he
wrote him that events had more than made
good his gloomiest predictions. Jefferson, however,
was utterly opposed to his theories, and
was much annoyed at the forcible way in which
he painted things as they were; characteristically
enough, he only showed his annoyance by
indirect methods,&mdash;leaving Morris's letters unanswered,
keeping him in the dark as to events
at home, etc. Morris understood all this perfectly,
and was extremely relieved when Randolph
became secretary of state in Jefferson's
stead. Almost immediately afterwards, however,
he was himself recalled. The United
States, having requested the French government
to withdraw Genet, a harlequin rather than a
diplomat, it was done at once, and in return a
request was forwarded that the United States
would reciprocate by relieving Morris, which of
course had to be done also. The revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
authorities both feared and disliked Morris; he
could neither be flattered nor bullied, and he
was known to disapprove of their excesses.
They also took umbrage at his haughtiness; an
unfortunate expression he used in one of his
official letters to them, "ma cour," gave great
offense, as being unrepublican&mdash;precisely as
they had previously objected to Washington's
using the phrase "your people" in writing to
the king.</p>

<p>Washington wrote him a letter warmly approving
of his past conduct. Nevertheless
Morris was not over-pleased at being recalled.
He thought that, as things then were in France,
any minister who gave satisfaction to its government
would prove forgetful of the interests
of America. He was probably right; at any
rate, what he feared was just what happened
under his successor, Monroe&mdash;a very amiable
gentleman, but distinctly one who comes in the
category of those whose greatness is thrust upon
them. However, under the circumstances, it
was probably impossible for our government to
avoid recalling Morris.</p>

<p>He could say truthfully: "I have the consolation
to have made no sacrifice either of personal
or national dignity, and I believe I should
have obtained everything if the American government
had refused to recall me." His services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
had been invaluable to us; he had kept
our national reputation at a high point, by the
scrupulous heed with which he saw that all our
obligations were fulfilled, as well as by the firm
courage with which he insisted on our rights
being granted us. He believed "that all our
treaties, however onerous, must be strictly fulfilled
according to their true intent and meaning.
The honest nation is that which, like the honest
man, 'hath to its plighted faith and vow forever
firmly stood, and though it promise to its
loss, yet makes that promise good;'" and in
return he demanded that others should mete to
us the same justice we meted to them. He met
each difficulty the instant it arose, ever on the
alert to protect his country and his countrymen;
and what an ordinary diplomat could barely
have done in time of peace, he succeeded in
doing amid the wild, shifting tumult of the Revolution,
when almost every step he made was at
his own personal hazard. He took precisely the
right stand; had he taken too hostile a position,
he would have been driven from the country,
whereas had he been a sympathizer, he would
have more or less compromised America, as his
successor afterwards did. We have never had
a foreign minister who deserved more honor
than Morris.</p>

<p>One of the noteworthy features in his letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
home was the accuracy with which he foretold
the course of events in the political world. Luzerne
once said to him, "Vous dites toujours les
chôses extraordinaires qui se realisent;" and
many other men, after some given event had
taken place, were obliged to confess their wonder
at the way in which Morris's predictions
concerning it had been verified. A notable instance
was his writing to Washington: "Whatever
may be the lot of France in remote futurity
... it seems evident that she must soon
be governed by a single despot. Whether she
will pass to that point through the medium of
a triumvirate or other small body of men, seems
as yet undetermined. I think it most probable
that she will." This was certainly a remarkably
accurate forecast as to the precise stages by
which the already existing despotism was to be
concentrated in a single individual. He always
insisted that, though it was difficult to foretell
how a single man would act, yet it was easy
with regard to a mass of men, for their peculiarities
neutralized each other, and it was necessary
only to pay heed to the instincts of the
average animal. He also gave wonderfully
clear-cut sketches of the more prominent actors
in affairs; although one of his maxims was that
"in examining historical facts we are too apt
to ascribe to individuals the events which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
produced by general causes." Danton, for instance,
he described as always believing, and,
what was worse for himself, maintaining, that
a popular system of government was absurd in
France; that the people were too ignorant, too
inconstant, too corrupt, and felt too much the
need of a master; in short, that they had
reached the point where Cato was a madman,
and Cæsar a necessary evil. He acted on these
principles; but he was too voluptuous for his
ambition, too indolent to acquire supreme
power, and he cared for great wealth rather
than great fame; so he "fell at the feet of
Robespierre." Similarly, said Morris, there
passed away all the men of the 10th of August,
all the men of the 2d of September; the same
mob that hounded them on with wild applause
when they grasped the blood-stained reins of
power, a few months later hooted at them with
ferocious derision as they went their way to the
guillotine. Paris ruled France, and the <i>sans
culottes</i> ruled Paris; factions continually arose,
waging inexplicable war, each in turn acquiring
a momentary influence which was founded on
fear alone, and all alike unable to build up any
stable or lasting government.</p>

<p>Each new stroke of the guillotine weakened
the force of liberal sentiment, and diminished
the chances of a free system. Morris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
wondered only that, in a country ripe for a
tyrant's rule, four years of convulsions among
twenty-four millions of people had brought
forth neither a soldier nor yet a statesman,
whose head was fitted to wear the cap that fortune
had woven. Despising the mob as utterly
as did Oliver Cromwell himself, and realizing
the supine indifference with which the French
people were willing to accept a master, he yet
did full justice to the pride with which they resented
outside attack, and the enthusiasm with
which they faced their foes. He saw the immense
resources possessed by a nation to whom
war abroad was a necessity for the preservation
of peace at home, and with whom bankruptcy
was but a starting-point for fresh efforts. The
whole energy and power lay in the hands of the
revolutionists; the men of the old regime had
fled, leaving only that "waxen substance," the
propertied class, "who in foreign wars count so
much, and in civil wars so little." He had no
patience with those despicable beings, the traders
and merchants who have forgotten how to
fight, the rich who are too timid to guard their
wealth, the men of property, large or small,
who need peace, and yet have not the sense and
courage to be always prepared to conquer it.</p>

<p>In his whole attitude towards the Revolution,
Morris represents better than any other man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the clear-headed, practical statesman, who is
genuinely devoted to the cause of constitutional
freedom. He was utterly opposed to the old
system of privilege on the one hand, and to the
wild excesses of the fanatics on the other. The
few liberals of the Revolution were the only
men in it who deserve our true respect. The
republicans who champion the deeds of the
Jacobins, are traitors to their own principles;
for the spirit of Jacobinism, instead of being
identical with, is diametrically opposed to the
spirit of true liberty. Jacobinism, socialism,
communism, nihilism, and anarchism&mdash;these
are the real foes of a democratic republic, for
each one, if it obtains control, obtains it only
as the sure forerunner of a despotic tyranny
and of some form of the one-man power.</p>

<p>Morris, an American, took a clearer and truer
view of the French Revolution than did any of
the contemporary European observers. Yet
while with them it was the all-absorbing event
of the age, with him, as is evident by his writings,
it was merely an important episode; for
to him it was dwarfed by the American Revolution
of a decade or two back. To the Europeans
of the present day, as yet hardly awake
to the fact that already the change has begun
that will make Europe but a fragment, instead
of the whole, of the civilized world, the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Revolution is the great historical event of our
times. But in reality it affected only the people
of western and central Europe; not the
Russians, not the English-speaking nations, not
the Spaniards who dwelt across the Atlantic.
America and Australia had their destinies
moulded by the crisis of 1776, not by the crisis
of 1789. What the French Revolution was to
the states within Europe, that the American
Revolution was to the continents without.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>STAY IN EUROPE.</h3>

<p>Monroe, as Morris's successor, entered upon
his new duties with an immense flourish, and
rapidly gave a succession of startling proofs that
he was a minister altogether too much to the
taste of the frenzied Jacobinical republicans to
whom he was accredited. Indeed, his capers
were almost as extraordinary as their own, and
seem rather like the antics of some of the early
French commanders in Canada, in their efforts
to ingratiate themselves with their Indian allies,
than like the performance we should expect
from a sober Virginian gentleman on a mission
to a civilized nation. He stayed long enough
to get our affairs into a snarl, and was then
recalled by Washington, receiving from the
latter more than one scathing rebuke.</p>

<p>However, the fault was really less with him
than with his party and with those who sent
him. Monroe was an honorable man with a
very un-original mind, and he simply reflected
the wild, foolish views held by all his fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of the Jeffersonian democratic-republican
school concerning France&mdash;for our politics
were still French and English, but not yet
American. His appointment was an excellent
example of the folly of trying to carry on a
government on a "non-partisan" basis. Washington
was only gradually weaned from this
theory by bitter experience; both Jefferson
and Monroe helped to teach him the lesson. It
goes without saying that in a well-ordered government
the great bulk of the employees in the
civil service, the men whose functions are merely
to execute faithfully routine departmental
work, should hold office during good behavior,
and should be appointed without reference to
their politics; but if the higher public servants,
such as the heads of departments and the foreign
ministers, are not in complete accord with
their chief, the only result can be to introduce
halting indecision and vacillation into the counsels
of the nation, without gaining a single compensating
advantage, and without abating by
one iota the virulence of party passion. To
appoint Monroe, an extreme Democrat, to
France, while at the same time appointing Jay,
a strong Federalist, to England, was not only
an absurdity which did nothing towards reconciling
the Federalists and Democrats, but, bearing
in mind how these parties stood respectively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
towards England and France, it was also an
actual wrong, for it made our foreign policy
seem double-faced and deceitful. While one
minister was formally embracing such of the
Parisian statesmen as had hitherto escaped
the guillotine, and was going through various
other theatrical performances that do not appeal
to any but a Gallic mind, his fellow was
engaged in negotiating a treaty in England that
was so obnoxious to France as almost to bring
us to a rupture with her. The Jay treaty was
not altogether a good one, and a better might
perhaps have been secured; still, it was better
than nothing, and Washington was right in
urging its adoption, even while admitting that
it was not entirely satisfactory. But certainly,
if we intended to enter into such engagements
with Great Britain, it was rank injustice to
both Monroe and France to send such a man
as the former to such a country as the latter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Morris, instead of returning to
America, was forced by his business affairs to
prolong his stay abroad for several years.
During this time he journeyed at intervals
through England, the Netherlands, Germany,
Prussia, and Austria. His European reputation
was well established, and he was everywhere
received gladly into the most distinguished
society of the time. What made him especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
welcome was his having now definitely taken
sides with the anti-revolutionists in the great
conflict of arms and opinions then raging
through Europe; and his brilliancy, the boldness
with which he had behaved as minister
during the Terror, and the reputation given him
by the French <i>emigrés</i>, all joined to cause him
to be hailed with pleasure by the aristocratic
party. It is really curious to see the consideration
with which he was everywhere treated,
although again a mere private individual, and
the terms of intimacy on which he was admitted
into the most exclusive social and diplomatic
circles at the various courts. He thus became
an intimate friend of many of the foremost
people of the period. His political observation,
however, became less trustworthy than heretofore;
for he was undoubtedly soured by his
removal, and the excesses of the revolutionists
had excited such horror in his mind as to make
him no longer an impartial judge. His forecasts
and judgments on the military situation
in particular, although occasionally right, were
usually very wild. He fully appreciated Napoleon's
utter unscrupulousness and marvelous
mendacity; but to the end of his life he remained
unwilling to do justice to the emperor's
still more remarkable warlike genius, going so
far, after the final Russian campaign, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
speak of old Kutusoff as his equal. Indeed, in
spite of one or two exceptions,&mdash;notably his
predicting almost the exact date of the retreat
from Moscow,&mdash;his criticisms on Napoleon's
military operations do not usually stand much
above the rather ludicrous level recently reached
by Count Tolstoï.</p>

<p>Morris was relieved by Monroe in August,
1794, and left Paris for Switzerland in October.
He stopped at Coppet and spent a day with
Madame de Staël, where there was a little
French society that lived at her expense and was
as gay as circumstances would permit. He had
never been particularly impressed with the much
vaunted society of the salon, and this small survival
thereof certainly had no overpowering attraction
for him, if we may judge by the entry
in his diary: "The road to her house is up-hill
and execrable, and I think I shall not again go
thither." Mankind was still blind to the grand
beauty of the Alps,&mdash;it must be remembered
that the admiration of mountain scenery is, to
the shame of our forefathers be it said, almost
a growth of the present century,&mdash;and Morris
took more interest in the Swiss population than
in their surroundings. He wrote that in Switzerland
the spirit of commerce had brought
about a baseness of morals which nothing could
cure but the same spirit carried still further:&mdash;"It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
teaches eventually fair dealing as the most
profitable dealing. The first lesson of trade is,
My son, get money. The second is, My son,
get money, honestly if you can, but get money.
The third is, My son, get money; but honestly,
if you would get much money."</p>

<p>He went to Great Britain in the following
summer, and spent a year there. At one time
he visited the North, staying with the Dukes
of Argyle, Atholl and Montrose, and was very
much pleased with Scotland, where everything
he saw convinced him that the country was
certain of a rapid and vigorous growth. On
his return he stopped with the Bishop of Landaff,
at Colgate Park. The bishop announced
that he was a stanch opposition man, and a
firm whig; to which statement Morris adds in
his diary: "Let this be as it will, he is certainly
a good landlord and a man of genius."</p>

<p>But Morris was now a favored guest in ministerial,
even more than in opposition circles;
he was considered to belong to what the czar
afterwards christened the "parti sain de l'Europe."
He saw a good deal of both Pitt and
Grenville, and was consulted by them not only
about American, but also about European
affairs; and a number of favors, which he asked
for some of his friends among the <i>emigrés</i>, were
granted. All his visits were not on business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
however; as, for instance, on July 14th:
"Dine at Mr. Pitt's. We sit down at six.
Lords Grenville, Chatham, and another come
later. The rule is established for six precisely,
which is right, I think. The wines are good
and the conversation flippant." Morris helped
Grenville in a number of ways, at the Prussian
court for instance; and was even induced by
him to write a letter to Washington, attempting
to put the English attitude toward us in a
good light. Washington, however, was no
more to be carried off his feet in favor of the
English than against them; and the facts he
brought out in his reply showed that Morris
had rather lost his poise, and had been hurried
into an action that was ill advised. He was
quite often at court; and relates a conversation
with the king, wherein that monarch's
language seems to have been much such as tradition
assigns him&mdash;short, abrupt sentences,
repetitions, and the frequent use of "what."</p>

<p>He also saw a good deal of the royalist refugees.
Some of them he liked and was intimate
with; but the majority disgusted him and made
him utterly impatient with their rancorous
folly. He commented on the strange levity
and wild negotiations of the Count d'Artois,
and prophesied that his character was such as
to make his projected attempt on La Vendée<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
hopeless from the start. Another day he was
at the Marquis de Spinola's: "The conversation
here, where our company consists of aristocrats
of the first feather, turns on French affairs.
They, at first, agree that union among the
French is necessary. But when they come to
particulars, they fly off and are mad. Madame
Spinola would send the Duke of Orleans to
Siberia. An abbé, a young man, talks much
and loud, to show his <i>esprit</i>; and to hear them
one would suppose they were quite at their ease
in a <i>petit souper de Paris</i>." Of that ponderous
exile, the chief of the House of Bourbon, and
afterwards Louis XVIII, he said that, in his
opinion, he had nothing to do but to try to get
shot, thereby redeeming by valor the foregone
follies of his conduct.</p>

<p>In June, 1796, Morris returned to the continent,
and started on another tour, in his own
carriage; having spent some time himself in
breaking in his young and restive horses to
their task. He visited all the different capitals,
at one time or another; among them, Berlin,
where, as usual, he was very well received.
For all his horror of Jacobinism, Morris was
a thorough American, perfectly independent,
without a particle of the snob in his disposition,
and valuing his acquaintances for what they
were, not for their titles. In his diary he puts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
down the Queen of England as "a well-bred,
sensible woman," and the Empress of Austria
as "a good sort of little woman," and contemptuously
dismisses the Prussian king with a word,
precisely as he does with any one else. One
of the entries in his journal, while he was staying
in Berlin, offers a case in point. "July 23d,
I dine, very much against my will, with Prince
Ferdinand. I was engaged to a very agreeable
party, but it seems the highnesses must never
be denied, unless it be from indisposition. I
had, however, written a note declining the intended
honor; but the messenger, upon looking
at it, for it was a letter patent, like the invitation,
said he could not deliver it; that nobody
ever refused; all of which I was informed of
after he was gone. On consulting I found that
I must go or give mortal offense, which last I
have no inclination to do; so I write another
note, and send out to hunt up the messenger.
While I am abroad this untoward incident is
arranged, and of course I am at Bellevue."
While at court on one occasion he met, and
took a great fancy to, the daughter of the famous
Baroness Riedesel; having been born in
the United States, she had been christened
America.</p>

<p>In one of his conversations with the king,
who was timid and hesitating, Morris told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
that the Austrians would be all right if he
would only lend them some Prussian generals&mdash;a
remark upon which Jena and Auerstadt
later on offered a curious commentary. He became
very impatient with the king's inability to
make up his mind; and wrote to the Duchess
of Cumberland that "the guardian angel of the
French Republic kept him lingering on this side
of the grave." He wrote to Lord Grenville
that Prussia was "seeking little things by little
means," and that the war with Poland was popular
"because the moral principles of a Prussian
go to the possession of whatever he can
acquire. And so little is he the slave of what
he calls vulgar prejudice, that, give him opportunity
and means, and he will spare you the
trouble of finding a pretext. This liberality
of sentiment greatly facilitates negotiation, for
it is not necessary to clothe propositions in honest
and decent forms." Morris was a most startling
phenomenon to the diplomatists of the day,
trampling with utter disregard on all their hereditary
theories of finesse and cautious duplicity.
The timid formalists, and more especially
those who considered double-dealing as the
legitimate, and in fact the only legitimate,
weapon of their trade, were displeased with
him; but he was very highly thought of by
such as could see the strength and originality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
of the views set forth in his frank, rather over-bold
language.</p>

<p>At Dresden he notes that he was late on the
day set down for his presentation at court,
owing to his valet having translated <i>halb zwölf</i>
as half past twelve. The Dresden picture galleries
were the first that drew from him any
very strong expressions of admiration. In the
city were numbers of the <i>emigrés</i>, fleeing from
their countrymen, and only permitted to stop
in Saxony for a few days; yet they were serene
and gay, and spent their time in busy sightseeing,
examining everything curious which
they could get at. Morris had become pretty
well accustomed to the way in which they met
fate; but such lively resignation surprised even
him, and he remarked that so great a calamity
had never lighted on shoulders so well fitted to
bear it.</p>

<p>At Vienna he made a long stay, not leaving
it until January, 1797. Here, as usual, he fraternized
at once with the various diplomatists;
the English ambassador, Sir Morton Eden, in
particular, going out of his way to show him
every attention. The Austrian prime minister,
M. Thugut, was also very polite; and so
were the foreign ministers of all the powers.
He was soon at home in the upper social circles
of this German Paris; but from the entries in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
his journal it is evident that he thought very
little of Viennese society. He liked talking and
the company of brilliant conversationalists, and
he abominated gambling; but in Vienna every
one was so devoted to play that there was no
conversation at all. He considered a dumb
circle round a card-table as the dullest society
in the world, and in Vienna there was little
else. Nor was he impressed with the ability
of the statesmen he met. He thought the Austrian
nobles to be on the decline; they stood
for the dying feudal system. The great families
had been squandering their riches with the
most reckless extravagance, and were becoming
broken and impoverished; and the imperial
government was glad to see the humiliation of
the haughty nobles, not perceiving that, if preserved,
they would act as a buffer between it
and the new power beginning to make itself
felt throughout Europe, and would save the
throne if not from total overthrow, at least
from shocks so fierce as greatly to weaken it.</p>

<p>Morris considered Prince Esterhazy as an
archtypical representative of the class. He was
captain of the noble Hungarian Guard, a small
body of tall, handsome men on fiery steeds,
magnificently caparisoned. The Prince, as its
commander, wore a Hungarian dress, scarlet,
with fur cape and cuffs, and yellow morocco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
boots; everything embroidered with pearls,
four hundred and seventy large ones, and many
thousand small, but all put on in good taste.
He had a collar of large diamonds, a plume of
diamonds in his cap; and his sword-hilt, scabbard,
and spurs were inlaid with the same
precious stones. His horse was equally bejeweled;
steed and rider, with their trappings,
"were estimated at a value of a quarter of a
million dollars." Old Blücher would surely
have considered the pair "very fine plunder."</p>

<p>The Prince was reported to be nominally the
richest subject in Europe, with a revenue that
during the Turkish war went up to a million
guilders annually; yet he was hopelessly in
debt already and getting deeper every year.
He lived in great magnificence, but was by no
means noted for lavish hospitality; all his extravagance
was reserved for himself, especially
for purposes of display. His Vienna stable
contained a hundred and fifty horses; and during
a six weeks' residence in Frankfort, where
he was ambassador at the time of an imperial
coronation, he spent eighty thousand pounds.
Altogether, an outsider may be pardoned for
not at first seeing precisely what useful function
such a merely gorgeous being performed in the
body politic; yet when summoned before the
bar of the new world-forces, Esterhazy and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
kind showed that birds of such fine feathers
sometimes had beaks and talons as well, and
knew how to use them, the craven flight of the
French noblesse to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Morris was often at court, where the constant
theme of conversation was naturally the
struggle with the French armies under Moreau
and Bonaparte. After one of these mornings
he mentions: "The levee was oddly arranged,
all the males being in one apartment, through
which the Emperor passes in going to chapel,
and returns the same way with the Empress
and imperial family; after which they go
through their own rooms to the ladies assembled
on the other side."</p>

<p>The English members of the <i>Corps Diplomatique</i>
in all the European capitals were especially
civil to him; and he liked them more
than their continental brethren. But for some
of their young tourist countrymen he cared
less; and it is curious to see that the ridicule
to which Americans have rightly exposed themselves
by their absurd fondness for uniforms
and for assuming military titles to which they
have no warrant, was no less deservedly earned
by the English at the end of the last century.
One of Morris's friends, Baron Groshlaer, being,
like the other Viennese, curious to know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
object of his stay,&mdash;they guessed aright that
he wished to get Lafayette liberated,&mdash;at last
almost asked him outright about it. "Finally
I tell him that the only difference between me
and the young Englishmen, of whom there is
a swarm here, is, that I seek instruction with
gray hairs and they with brown.... At the
Archduchess's one of the little princes, brother
to the Emperor, and who is truly an <i>arch</i>-duke,
asks me to explain to him the different uniforms
worn by the young English, of whom there are
a great number here, all in regimentals. Some
of these belong to no corps at all, and the others
to yeomanry, fencibles and the like, all of
which purport to be raised for the defense of
their country in case she should be invaded; but
now, when the invasion seems most imminent,
they are abroad, and cannot be made to feel
the ridiculous indecency of appearing in regimentals.
Sir M. Eden and others have given
them the broadest hints without the least effect.
One of them told me that all the world should
not laugh him out of his regimentals. I
bowed.... I tell the prince that I really am
not able to answer his question, but that, in
general, their dresses I believe are worn for
convenience in traveling. He smiles at this....
If I were an Englishman I should be hurt
at these exhibitions, and as it is I am sorry for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
them.... I find that here they assume it as
unquestionable that the young men of England
have a right to adjust the ceremonial of
Vienna. The political relations of the two
countries induce the good company here to treat
them with politeness; but nothing prevents
their being laughed at, as I found the other
evening at Madame de Groshlaer's, where the
young women as well as the girls were very
merry at the expense of these young men."</p>

<p>After leaving Vienna he again passed
through Berlin, and in a conversation with the
king he foreshadowed curiously the state of
politics a century later, and showed that he
thoroughly appreciated the cause that would in
the end reconcile the traditional enmity of the
Hohenzollerns and Hapsburgs. "After some
trifling things I tell him that I have just seen
his best friend. He asks who? and, to his
great surprise, I reply, the Emperor. He
speaks of him well personally, and I observe
that he is a very honest young man, to which
his Majesty replies by asking, "Mais, que
pensez vous de Thugut." "Quant à cela, c'est
une autre affaire, sire." I had stated the interest,
which makes him and the Emperor good
friends, to be their mutual apprehensions from
Russia. "But suppose we all three unite?"
"Ce sera un diable de fricassée, sire, si vous
vous mettez tous les trois à casser les &#339;ufs.""</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
At Brunswick he was received with great
hospitality, the Duke, and particularly the
Duchess Dowager, the King of England's
sister, treating him very hospitably. He here
saw General Riedesel, with whom he was
most friendly; the general in the course of
conversation inveighed bitterly against Burgoyne.
He went to Munich also, where he was
received on a very intimate footing by Count
Rumford, then the great power in Bavaria,
who was busily engaged in doing all he could
to better the condition of his country. Morris
was much interested in his reforms. They
were certainly needed; the Count told his
friend that on assuming the reins of power, the
abuses to be remedied were beyond belief&mdash;for
instance, there was one regiment of cavalry
that had five field officers and only three
horses. With some of the friends that Morris
made&mdash;such as the Duchess of Cumberland,
the Princess de la Tour et Taxis and others&mdash;he
corresponded until the end of his life.</p>

<p>While at Vienna he again did all he could
to get Lafayette released from prison, where
his wife was confined with him; but in vain.
Madame de Lafayette's sister, the Marquise de
Montagu, and Madame de Staël, both wrote
him the most urgent appeals to do what he
could for the prisoners; the former writing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
"My sister is in danger of losing the life you
saved in the prisons of Paris ... has not he
whom Europe numbers among those citizens
of whom North America ought to be most
proud, has not he the right to make himself
heard in favor of a citizen of the United States,
and of a wife, whose life belongs to him, since
he has preserved it?" Madame de Staël felt
the most genuine grief for Lafayette, and very
sincere respect for Morris; and in her letters
to the latter she displayed both sentiments with
a lavish exaggeration that hardly seems in good
taste. If Morris had needed a spur the letters
would have supplied it; but the task was an
impossible one, and Lafayette was not released
until the peace in 1797, when he was turned
over to the American consul at Hamburg, in
Morris's presence.</p>

<p>Morris was able to render more effectual help
to an individual far less worthy of it than Lafayette.
This was the then Duke of Orleans,
afterwards King Louis Philippe, who had fled
from France with Dumouriez. Morris's old
friend, Madame de Flahaut, appealed to him
almost hysterically on the duke's behalf; and
he at once did even more than she requested,
giving the duke money wherewith to go to
America, and also furnishing him with unlimited
credit at his own New York banker's, during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
wanderings in the United States. This was
done for the sake of the Duchess of Orleans,
to whom Morris was devotedly attached, not
for the sake of the duke himself. The latter
knew this perfectly, writing: "Your kindness
is a blessing I owe to my mother and to our
friend" (Madame de Flahaut). The bourgeois
king admirably represented the meanest, smallest
side of the bourgeois character; he was not
a bad man, but he was a very petty and contemptible
one; had he been born in a different
station of life, he would have been just the individual
to take a prominent part in local temperance
meetings, while he sanded the sugar
he sold in his corner grocery. His treatment
of Morris's loan was characteristic. When he
came into his rights again, at the Restoration,
he at first appeared to forget his debt entirely,
and when his memory was jogged, he merely
sent Morris the original sum, without a word
of thanks; whereupon Morris, rather nettled,
and as prompt to stand up for his rights against
a man in prosperity as he had been to help him
when in adversity, put the matter in the hands
of his lawyer, through whom he notified Louis
Philippe that if the affair was to be treated on
a merely business basis, it should then be treated
in a strictly business way, and the interest for
the twenty years that had gone by should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
forwarded also. This was accordingly done,
although not until after Morris's death, the entire
sum refunded being seventy thousand
francs.</p>

<p>Morris brought his complicated business affairs
in Europe to a close in 1798, and sailed
from Hamburg on October 4th of that year,
reaching New York after an exceedingly tedious
and disagreeable voyage of eighty days.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.</h3>

<p>Morris was very warmly greeted on his return;
and it was evident that the length of his
stay abroad had in nowise made him lose
ground with his friends at home. His natural
affiliations were all with the Federalist party,
which he immediately joined.</p>

<p>During the year 1799 he did not take much
part in politics, as he was occupied in getting
his business affairs in order and in putting to
rights his estates at Morrisania. The old manor
house had become such a crazy, leaky affair
that he tore it down and built a new one; a
great, roomy building, not in the least showy,
but solid, comfortable, and in perfect taste;
having, across the tree-clad hills of Westchester,
a superb view of the Sound, with its jagged
coast and capes and islands.</p>

<p>Although it was so long since he had practiced
law, he was shortly engaged in a very important
case that was argued for eight days
before the Court of Errors in Albany. Few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
trials in the State of New York have ever
brought together such a number of men of remarkable
legal ability; for among the lawyers
engaged on one side or the other were Morris,
Hamilton, Burr, Robert Livingstone, and Troup.
There were some sharp passages of arms: and
the trial of wits between Morris and Hamilton
in particular were so keen as to cause a passing
coolness.</p>

<p>During the ten years that had gone by since
Morris sailed for Europe, the control of the
national government had been in the hands of
the Federalists; when he returned, party bitterness
was at the highest pitch, for the Democrats
were preparing to make the final push for
power which should overthrow and ruin their
antagonists. Four-fifths of the talent, ability,
and good sense of the country were to be found
in the Federalist ranks; for the Federalists
had held their own so far, by sheer force of
courage and intellectual vigor, over foes in reality
more numerous. Their great prop had been
Washington. His colossal influence was to the
end decisive in party contests, and he had in
fact, although hardly in name, almost entirely
abandoned his early attempts at non-partisanship,
had grown to distrust Madison as he long
before had distrusted Jefferson, and had come
into constantly closer relations with their enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
His death diminished greatly the chances
of Federalist success; there were two other
causes at work that destroyed them entirely.</p>

<p>One of these was the very presence in the
dominant party of so many men nearly equal in
strong will and great intellectual power; their
ambitions and theories clashed; even the loftiness
of their aims, and their disdain of everything
small, made them poor politicians, and
with Washington out of the way there was no
one commander to overawe the rest and to keep
down the fierce bickerings constantly arising
among them; while in the other party there
was a single leader, Jefferson, absolutely without
a rival, but supported by a host of sharp
political workers, most skillful in marshaling
that unwieldy and hitherto disunited host of
voters who were inferior in intelligence to their
fellows.</p>

<p>The second cause lay deep in the nature of
the Federalist organization: it was its distrust
of the people. This was the fatally weak
streak in Federalism. In a government such as
ours it was a foregone conclusion that a party
which did not believe in the people would
sooner or later be thrown from power unless
there was an armed break-up of the system.
The distrust was felt, and of course excited
corresponding and intense hostility. Had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Federalists been united, and had they freely
trusted in the people, the latter would have
shown that the trust was well founded; but
there was no hope for leaders who suspected
each other and feared their followers.</p>

<p>Morris landed just as the Federalist reaction,
brought about by the conduct of France, had
spent itself,&mdash;thanks partly to some inopportune
pieces of insolence from England, in
which country, as Morris once wrote to a foreign
friend, "on a toujours le bon esprit de vouloir
prendre les mouches avec du vinaigre." The
famous alien and sedition laws were exciting
great disgust, and in Virginia and Kentucky
Jefferson was using them as handles wherewith
to guide seditious agitation&mdash;not that he believed
in sedition, but because he considered it
good party policy, for the moment, to excite
it. The parties hated each other with rancorous
virulence; the newspapers teemed with the
foulest abuse of public men, accusations of
financial dishonesty were rife, Washington himself
not being spared, and the most scurrilous
personalities were bandied about between the
different editors. The Federalists were split
into two factions, one following the President,
Adams, in his efforts to keep peace with France,
if it could be done with honor, while the others,
under Hamilton's lead, wished war at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Pennsylvanian politics were already very low.
The leaders who had taken control were men of
mean capacity and small morality, and the
State was not only becoming rapidly democratic
but was also drifting along in a disorganized,
pseudo-jacobinical, half insurrectionary kind of
way that would have boded ill for its future
had it not been fettered by the presence of
healthier communities round about it. New
England was the only part of the community,
excepting Delaware, where Federalism was on
a perfectly sound footing; for in that section
there was no caste spirit, the leaders and their
followers were thoroughly in touch, and all the
citizens, shrewd, thrifty, independent, were used
to self-government, and fully awake to the fact
that honesty and order are the prerequisites of
liberty. Yet even here Democracy had made
some inroads.</p>

<p>South of the Potomac the Federalists had lost
ground rapidly. Virginia was still a battlefield;
as long as Washington lived, his tremendous
personal influence acted as a brake on the democratic
advance, and the state's greatest orator,
Patrick Henry, had halted beside the grave to
denounce the seditious schemes of the disunion
agitators with the same burning, thrilling eloquence
that, thirty years before, had stirred to
their depths the hearts of his hearers when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
bade defiance to the tyrannous might of the
British king. But when these two men were
dead, Marshall,&mdash;though destined, as chief and
controlling influence in the third division of our
governmental system, to mould the whole of
that system on the lines of Federalist thought,
and to prove that a sound judiciary could
largely affect an unsound executive and legislature,&mdash;even
Marshall could not, single-handed,
stem the current that had gradually gathered
head. Virginia stands easily first among all
our commonwealths for the statesmen and warriors
she has brought forth; and it is noteworthy
that during the long contest between
the nationalists and separatists, which forms
the central fact in our history for the first
three quarters of a century of our national life,
she gave leaders to both sides at the two great
crises: Washington and Marshall to the one,
and Jefferson to the other, when the question
was one of opinion as to whether the Union
should be built up; and when the appeal to
arms was made to tear it down, Farragut and
Thomas to the north, Lee and Jackson to the
south.</p>

<p>There was one eddy in the tide of democratic
success that flowed so strongly to the
southward. This was in South Carolina. The
fierce little Palmetto state has always been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
free lance among her southern sisters; for
instance, though usually ultra-democratic, she
was hostile to the two great democratic chiefs,
Jefferson and Jackson, though both were from
the south. At the time that Morris came
home, the brilliant little group of Federalist
leaders within her bounds, headed by men of
national renown like Pinckney and Harper,
kept her true to Federalism by downright force
of intellect and integrity; for they were among
the purest as well as the ablest statesmen of
the day.</p>

<p>New York had been going through a series
of bitter party contests; any one examining a
file of papers of that day will come to the conclusion
that party spirit was even more violent
and unreasonable then than now. The two
great Federalist leaders, Hamilton and Jay,
stood head and shoulders above all their democratic
competitors, and they were backed by the
best men in the state, like Rufus King, Schuyler
and others. But, though as orators and
statesmen they had no rivals, they were very
deficient in the arts of political management.
Hamilton's imperious haughtiness had alienated
the powerful family of the Livingstones, who
had thrown in their lot with the Clintonians;
and a still more valuable ally to the latter had
arisen in that consummate master of "machine"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
politics, Aaron Burr. In 1792, Jay, then chief
justice of the United States, had run for governor
against Clinton, and had received the
majority of the votes; but had been counted
out by the returning board in spite of the protest
of its four Federalist members&mdash;Gansevoort,
Roosevelt, Jones, and Sands. The indignation
was extreme, and only Jay's patriotism
and good sense prevented an outbreak. However,
the memory of the fraud remained fresh
in the minds of the citizens, and at the next
election for governor he was chosen by a heavy
majority, having then just come back from his
mission to England. Soon afterwards his treaty
was published, and excited a whirlwind of indignation;
it was only ratified in the senate
through Washington's great influence, backed
by the magnificent oratory of Fisher Ames,
whose speech on this occasion, when he was
almost literally on his death-bed, ranks among
the half dozen greatest of our country. The
treaty was very objectionable in certain points,
but it was most necessary to our well-being,
and Jay was probably the only American who
could have negotiated it. As with the Ashburton
treaty many years later, extreme sections in
England attacked it as fiercely as did the extreme
sections here; and Lord Sheffield voiced
their feelings when he hailed the war of 1812<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
as offering a chance to England to get back the
advantages out of which "Jay had duped Grenville."</p>

<p>But the clash with France shortly afterwards
swept away the recollection of the treaty, and
Jay was reëlected in 1798. One of the arguments,
by the way, which was used against him
in the canvass was that he was an abolitionist.
But, in spite of his reëlection, the New York
Democrats were steadily gaining ground.</p>

<p>Such was the situation when Morris returned.
He at once took high rank among the Federalists,
and in April, 1800, just before the final
wreck of their party, was chosen by them to
fill an unexpired term of three years in the
United States Senate. Before this he had made
it evident that his sympathies lay with Hamilton
and those who did not think highly of
Adams. He did not deem it wise to renominate
the latter for the Presidency. He had
even written to Washington, earnestly beseeching
him to accept the nomination; but Washington
died a day or two after the letter was
sent. In spite of the jarring between the leaders,
the Federalists nominated Adams and
Pinckney. In the ensuing Presidential election
many of the party chiefs, notably Marshall of
Virginia, already a strong Adams man, faithfully
stood by the ticket in its entirety; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Hamilton, Morris, and many others at the
North probably hoped in their hearts that, by
the aid of the curious electoral system which
then existed, some chance would put the great
Carolinian in the first place and make him
President. Indeed, there is little question that
this might have been done, had not Pinckney,
one of the most high-minded and disinterested
statesmen we have ever had, emphatically declined
to profit in any way by the hurting of
the grim old Puritan.</p>

<p>The house thus divided against itself naturally
fell, and Jefferson was chosen President.
It was in New York that the decisive struggle
took place, for that was the pivotal state; and
there the Democrats, under the lead of the Livingstones
and Clintons, but above all by the
masterly political manoeuvres of Aaron Burr,
gained a crushing victory. Hamilton, stung to
madness by the defeat, and sincerely believing
that the success of his opponents would be fatal
to the republic,&mdash;for the two parties hated each
other with a blind fury unknown to the organizations
of the present day,&mdash;actually proposed
to Jay, the governor, to nullify the action of the
people by the aid of the old legislature, a Federalist
body, which was still holding over, although
the members of its successor had been
chosen. Jay, as pure as he was brave, refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
to sanction any such scheme of unworthy partisanship.
It is worth noting that the victors in
this election introduced for the first time the
"spoils system," in all its rigor, into our state
affairs; imitating the bad example of Pennsylvania
a year or two previously.</p>

<p>When the Federalists in Congress, into which
body the choice for President had been thrown,
took up Burr, as a less objectionable alternative
than Jefferson, Morris, much to his credit,
openly and heartily disapproved of the movement,
and was sincerely glad that it failed. For
he thought Burr far the more dangerous man of
the two, and, moreover, did not believe that
the evident intention of the people should be
thwarted. Both he and Hamilton, on this occasion,
acted more wisely and more honestly
than did most of their heated fellow-partisans.
Writing to the latter, the former remarked:
"It is dangerous to be impartial in politics;
you, who are temperate in drinking, have never
perhaps noticed the awkward situation of a
man who continues sober after the company are
drunk."</p>

<p>Morris joined the Senate at Philadelphia in
May, 1800, but it almost immediately adjourned,
to meet at Washington in November, when he
was again present. Washington, as it then
was, was a place whose straggling squalor has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
often been described. Morris wrote to the
Princess de la Tour et Taxis, that it needed
nothing "but houses, cellars, kitchens, well-informed
men, amiable women, and other little
trifles of the kind to make the city perfect;"
that it was "the very best city in the world for
a future residence," but that as he was "not
one of those good people whom we call posterity,"
he would meanwhile like to live somewhere
else.</p>

<p>During his three years' term in the Senate he
was one of the strong pillars of the Federalist
party; but he was both too independent and
too erratic to act always within strict party
lines, and while he was an ultra-Federalist on
some points, he openly abandoned his fellows
on others. He despised Jefferson as a tricky
and incapable theorist, skillful in getting votes,
but in nothing else; a man who believed "in
the wisdom of mobs, and the moderation of
Jacobins," and who found himself "in the
wretched plight of being forced to turn out
good officers to make room for the unworthy."</p>

<p>After the election that turned them out of
power, but just before their opponents took office,
the Federalists in the Senate and House
passed the famous judiciary bill, and Adams
signed it. It provided for a number of new
federal judges to act throughout the states,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
while the supreme court was retained as the
ultimate court of decision. It was an excellent
measure, inasmuch as it simplified the work of
the judiciary, saved the highest branch from
useless traveling, prevented the calendars from
being choked with work, and supplied an upright
federal judiciary to certain districts where
the local judges could not be depended upon to
act honestly. On the other hand, the Federalists
employed it as a means to keep themselves
partly in power, after the nation had decided
that they should be turned out. Although the
Democrats had bitterly opposed it, yet if, as was
only right, the offices created by it had been left
vacant until Jefferson came in, it would probably
have been allowed to stand. But Adams,
most improperly, spent the last hours of his administration
in putting in the new judges.</p>

<p>Morris, who heartily championed the measure,
wrote his reasons for so doing to Livingstone;
giving, with his usual frankness, those that
were political and improper, as well as those
based on some public policy, but apparently not
appreciating the gravity of the charges he so
lightly admitted. He said: "The new judiciary
bill may have, and doubtless has, many
little faults, but it answers the double purpose
of bringing justice near to men's doors, and of
giving additional fibre to the root of government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
You must not, my friend, judge of other
states by your own. Depend on it, that in
some parts of this Union, justice cannot be
readily obtained in the state courts." So far,
he was all right, and the truth of his statements,
and the soundness of his reasons, could not be
challenged as to the propriety of the law itself;
but he was much less happy in giving his views
of the way in which it would be carried out:
"That the leaders of the federal party may use
this opportunity to provide for friends and adherents
is, I think, probable; and if they were
my enemies, I should blame them for it.
Whether I should do the same thing myself is
another question.... They are about to experience
a heavy gale of adverse wind; can
they be blamed for casting many anchors to
hold their ship through the storm?" Most
certainly they should be blamed for casting
this particular kind of anchor; it was a very
gross outrage for them to "provide for friends
and adherents" in such a manner.</p>

<p>The folly of their action was seen at once;
for they had so maddened the Democrats that
the latter repealed the act as soon as they came
into power. This also was of course all wrong,
and was a simple sacrifice of a measure of good
government to partisan rage. Morris led the
fight against it, deeming the repeal not only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the highest degree unwise but also unconstitutional.
After the repeal was accomplished, the
knowledge that their greed to grasp office under
the act was probably the cause of the loss of an
excellent law, must have been rather a bitter
cud for the Federalists to chew. Morris always
took an exaggerated view of the repeal, regarding
it as a death-blow to the constitution. It
was certainly a most unfortunate affair throughout;
and much of the blame attaches to the Federalists,
although still more to their antagonists.</p>

<p>The absolute terror with which even moderate
Federalists had viewed the victory of the
Democrats was in a certain sense justifiable;
for the leaders who led the Democrats to
triumph were the very men who had fought
tooth and nail against every measure necessary
to make us a free, orderly, and powerful nation.
But the safety of the nation really lay in the
very fact that the policy hitherto advocated by
the now victorious party had embodied principles
so wholly absurd in practice that it was
out of the question to apply them at all to the
actual running of the government. Jefferson
could write or speak&mdash;and could feel too&mdash;the
most high-sounding sentiments; but once it
came to actions he was absolutely at sea, and
on almost every matter&mdash;especially where he
did well&mdash;he had to fall back on the Federalist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
theories. Almost the only important point on
which he allowed himself free scope was that of
the national defenses; and here, particularly as
regards the navy, he worked very serious harm
to the country. Otherwise he generally adopted
and acted on the views of his predecessors;
as Morris said, the Democrats "did more to
strengthen the executive than Federalists dared
think of, even in Washington's day." As a
consequence, though the nation would certainly
have been better off if men like Adams or
Pinckney had been retained at the head of affairs,
yet the change resulted in far less harm
than it bade fair to.</p>

<p>On the other hand the Federalists cut a very
sorry figure in opposition. We have never had
another party so little able to stand adversity.
They lost their temper first and they lost their
principles next, and actually began to take up
the heresies discarded by their adversaries.
Morris himself, untrue to all his previous record,
advanced various states-rights doctrines; and
the Federalists, the men who had created the
Union, ended their days under the grave suspicion
of having desired to break it up. Morris
even opposed, and on a close vote temporarily
defeated, the perfectly unobjectionable proposition
to change the electoral system by designating
the candidates for President and Vice-President;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the reason he gave was that he believed
parties should be forced to nominate both of
their best men, and that he regarded the Jefferson-Burr
tie as a beautiful object-lesson for
teaching this point!</p>

<p>On one most important question, however, he
cut loose from his party, who were entirely in
the wrong, and acted with the administration,
who were behaving in strict accordance with
Federalist precepts. This was in reference to
the treaty by which we acquired Louisiana.</p>

<p>While in opposition, one of the most discreditable
features of the Republican-Democratic
party had been its servile truckling to
France, which at times drove it into open disloyalty
to America. Indeed this subservience
to foreigners was a feature of our early party
history; and the most confirmed pessimist
must admit that, as regards patriotism and indignant
intolerance of foreign control, the party
organizations of to-day are immeasurably superior
to those of eighty or ninety years back.
But it was only while in opposition that either
party was ready to throw itself into the arms
of outsiders. Once the Democrats took the
reins they immediately changed their attitude.
The West demanded New Orleans and the
valley of the Mississippi; and what it demanded
it was determined to get. When we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
only had the decaying weakness of Spain to
deal with, there was no cause for hurry; but
when Louisiana was ceded to France, at the
time when the empire of Napoleon was a match
for all the rest of the world put together, the
country was up in arms at once.</p>

<p>The Administration promptly began to negotiate
for the purchase of Louisiana. Morris
backed them up heartily, thus splitting off
from the bulk of the Federalists, and earnestly
advocated far stronger measures than had been
taken. He believed that so soon as the French
should establish themselves in New Orleans,
we should have a war with them; he knew it
would be impossible for the haughty chiefs of
a military despotism long to avoid collisions
with the reckless and warlike backwoodsmen
of the border. Nor would he have been sorry
had such a war taken place. He said that it
was a necessity to us, for we were dwindling
into a race of mere speculators and driveling
philosophers, whereas ten years of warfare
would bring forth a crop of heroes and statesmen,
fit timber out of which to hew an empire.</p>

<p>Almost his last act in the United States Senate
was to make a most powerful and telling
speech in favor of at once occupying the territory
in dispute, and bidding defiance to Napoleon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
He showed that we could not submit
to having so dangerous a neighbor as France,
an ambitious and conquering nation, at whose
head was the greatest warrior of the age. With
ringing emphasis he claimed the western regions
as peculiarly our heritage, as the property
of the fathers of America which they held
in trust for their children. It was true that
France was then enjoying the peace which she
had wrung from the gathered armies of all
Europe; yet he advised us to fling down the
gauntlet fearlessly, not hampering ourselves by
an attempt at alliance with Great Britain or
any other power, but resting confident that, if
America was heartily in earnest, she would be
able to hold her own in any struggle. The cost
of the conquest he brushed contemptuously
aside; he considered "that counting-house
policy, which sees nothing but money, a poor,
short-sighted, half-witted, mean, and miserable
thing, as far removed from wisdom as is a
monkey from a man." He wished for peace;
but he did not believe the Emperor would
yield us the territory, and he knew that his
fellow-representatives, and practically all the
American people, were determined to fight for
it if they could get it in no other way; therefore
he advised them to begin at once, and
gain forthwith what they wanted, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
their example would inspirit Europe to rise
against the tyrant.</p>

<p>It was bold advice, and if need had arisen it
would have been followed; for we were bound
to have Louisiana, if not by bargain and sale
then by fair shock of arms. But Napoleon
yielded, and gave us the land for fifteen millions,
of which, said Morris, "I am content to
pay my share to deprive foreigners of all pretext
for entering our interior country; if nothing
else were gained by the treaty, that alone
would satisfy me."</p>

<p>Morris's term as senator expired on March
4th, 1803, and he was not reëlected; for New
York State had passed into the hands of the
Democrats. But he still continued to play a
prominent part in public affairs, for he was the
leader in starting the project of the Erie canal.
It was to him that we owe the original idea of
this great water-way, for he thought of it and
planned it out long before any one else. He
had publicly proposed it during the revolutionary
period; in 1803 he began the agitation in
its favor that culminated in its realization, and
he was chairman of the Canal Commissioners
from the time of their appointment, in 1810,
until within a few months of his death. The
three first reports of the Commission were all
from his pen. As Stephen Van Rensselaer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
himself one of the commissioners from the
beginning, said, "Gouverneur Morris was the
father of our great canal." He hoped ultimately
to make it a ship canal. While a member
of the commission, he not only discharged his
duties as such with characteristic energy and
painstaking, but he also did most effective outside
work in advancing the enterprise, while
he mastered the subject more thoroughly in all
its details than did any other man.</p>

<p>He spent most of his time at Morrisania, but
traveled for two or three months every summer,
sometimes going out to the then "far
West," along the shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario,
and once descending the St. Lawrence.
At home he spent his time tilling his farm,
reading, receiving visits from his friends, and
carrying on a wide correspondence on business
and politics. Jay's home was within driving
distance, and the two fine old fellows saw much
of each other. On the 25th of December, 1809,
Morris, then fifty-six years old, married Miss
Anne Cary Randolph, a member of the famous
Virginia family; he was very happy with her,
and by her he had one son. Three weeks after
the marriage he wrote Jay a pressing request
to visit him: "I pray you will, with your
daughters, embark immediately in your sleigh,
after a very early breakfast, and push on so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
to reach this house in the evening. My wife
sends her love, and says she longs to receive
her husband's friend; that his sickness must be
no excuse, for she will nurse him. Come, then,
and see your old friend perform his part in an
old-fashioned scene of domestic enjoyment."
Jay was very simple in his way of living; but
Morris was rather formal. When he visited
his friend he always came with his valet, was
shown straight to his room without seeing any
one, dressed himself with scrupulous nicety,&mdash;being
very particular about his powdered hair,&mdash;and
then came down to see his host.</p>

<p>Although his letters generally dealt with
public matters, he sometimes went into home
details. He thus wrote an amusing letter to a
good friend of his, a lady, who was desirous,
following the custom of the day, to send her
boy to what was called a "college" at an absurdly
early age; he closed by warning her
that "these children of eleven, after a four
years' course, in which they may learn to smatter
a little of everything, become bachelors of
arts before they know how to button their
clothes, and are the most troublesome and useless,
sometimes the most pernicious, little animals
that ever infested a commonwealth."</p>

<p>At one time he received as his guest Moreau,
the exiled French general, then seeking service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
in the United States. Writing in his diary an
account of the visit, he says: "In the course
of our conversation, touching very gently the
idea of his serving (in case of necessity) against
France, he declares frankly that, when the occasion
arrives, he shall feel no reluctance; that
France having cast him out, he is a citizen of
the country where he lives, and has the same
right to follow his trade here as any other man."</p>

<p>He took the keenest pleasure in his life, and
always insisted that America was the pleasantest
of all places in which to live. Writing to
a friend abroad, and mentioning that he respected
the people of Britain, but did not find
them congenial, he added: "But were the manners
of those countries as pleasant as the people
are respectable, I should never be reconciled to
their summers. Compare the uninterrupted
warmth and splendor of America, from the first
of May to the last of September, and her autumn,
truly celestial, with your shivering June,
your July and August sometimes warm but
often wet, your uncertain September, your
gloomy October, and your dismal November.
Compare these things, and then say how a man
who prizes the charm of Nature can think of
making the exchange. If you were to pass one
autumn with us, you would not give it for the
best six months to be found in any other country....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
There is a brilliance in our atmosphere
of which you can have no idea."</p>

<p>He thoroughly appreciated the marvelous
future that lay before the race on this continent.
Writing in 1801, he says: "As yet we only
crawl along the outer shell of our country. The
interior excels the part we inhabit in soil, in
climate, in everything. The proudest empire
in Europe is but a bauble compared to what
America <i>will</i> be, <i>must</i> be, in the course of two
centuries, perhaps of one!" And again, "With
respect to this country, calculation outruns
fancy, and fact outruns calculation."</p>

<p>Until his hasty, impulsive temper became so
soured by partisanship as to warp his judgment,
Morris remained as well satisfied with
the people and the system of government as
with the land itself. In one of his first letters
after his return to America he wrote: "There
is a fund of good sense and calmness of character
here, which will, I think, avoid all dangerous
excesses. We are free: we know it: and
we know how to continue free." On another
occasion, about the same time, he said: "<i>Nil
desperandum de republica</i> is a sound principle."
Again, in the middle of Jefferson's first term:
"We have indeed a set of madmen in the administration,
and they will do many foolish
things; but there is a vigorous vegetative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
principle at the root which will make our tree
flourish, let the winds blow as they may."</p>

<p>He at first took an equally just view of our
political system, saying that in adopting a republican
form of government he "not only took
it, as a man does his wife, for better or worse,
but, what few men do with their wives, knowing
all its bad qualities." He observed that
there was always a counter current in human
affairs, which opposed alike good and evil.
"Thus the good we hope is seldom attained,
and the evil we fear is rarely realized. The
leaders of faction must for their own sakes avoid
errors of enormous magnitude; so that, while
the republican form lasts, we shall be fairly
well governed." He thought this form the
one best suited for us, and remarked that "every
kind of government was liable to evil; that the
best was that which had fewest faults; that
the excellence even of that best depended
more on its fitness for the nation where it was
established than on intrinsic perfection." He
denounced, with a fierce scorn that they richly
merit, the despicable demagogues and witless
fools who teach that in all cases the voice of the
majority must be implicitly obeyed, and that
public men have only to carry out its will, and
thus "acknowledge themselves the willing instruments
of folly and vice. They declare that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
in order to please the people they will, regardless
alike of what conscience may dictate or reason
approve, make the profligate sacrifice of public
right on the altar of private interest. What
more can be asked by the sternest tyrant of the
most despicable slave? Creatures of this sort
are the tools which usurpers employ in building
despotism."</p>

<p>Sounder and truer maxims never were uttered;
but unfortunately the indignation naturally
excited by the utter weakness and folly
of Jefferson's second term, and the pitiable incompetence
shown both by him, by his successor,
and by their party associates in dealing
with affairs, so inflamed and exasperated Morris
as to make him completely lose his head, and
hurried him into an opposition so violent that
his follies surpassed the worst of the follies he
condemned. He gradually lost faith in our republican
system, and in the Union itself. His
old jealousy of the West revived more strongly
than ever; he actually proposed that our enormous
masses of new territory, destined one day
to hold the bulk of our population, "should be
governed as provinces, and allowed no voice in
our councils." So hopelessly futile a scheme
is beneath comment; and it cannot possibly be
reconciled with his previous utterances when
he descanted on our future greatness as a people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and claimed the West as the heritage of our children.
His conduct can only be unqualifiedly
condemned; and he has but the poor palliation
that, in our early history, many of the leading
men in New York, and an even larger proportion
in New England, felt the same narrow,
illiberal jealousy of the West which had
formerly been felt by the English statesmen for
America as a whole.</p>

<p>It is well indeed for our land that we of
this generation have at last learned to think
nationally, and, no matter in what state we live,
to view our whole country with the pride of
personal possession.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE NORTHERN DISUNION MOVEMENT AMONG
THE FEDERALISTS.</h3>

<p>It is a painful thing to have to record that
the closing act in a great statesman's career not
only compares ill with what went before, but
is actually to the last degree a discreditable and
unworthy performance.</p>

<p>Morris's bitterness and anger against the government
grew apace; and finally his hatred
for the administration became such, that, to
hurt it, he was willing also to do irreparable
harm to the nation itself. He violently opposed
the various embargo acts, and all the
other governmental measures of the decade before
the war; and worked himself up to such
a pitch, when hostilities began, that, though one
of the founders of the Constitution, though formerly
one of the chief exponents of the national
idea, and though once a main upholder of the
Union, he abandoned every patriotic principle
and became an ardent advocate of Northern
secession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
To any reasoning student of American history
it goes without saying that there was very good
cause for his anger with the administration.
From the time the House of Virginia came
into power, until the beginning of Monroe's administration,
there was a distinctly anti-New
England feeling at Washington, and much of
the legislation bore especially heavily on the
Northeast. Excepting Jefferson, we have never
produced an executive more helpless than Madison,
when it came to grappling with real dangers
and difficulties. Like his predecessor, he
was only fit to be President in a time of profound
peace; he was utterly out of place the
instant matters grew turbulent, or difficult problems
arose to be solved, and he was a ridiculously
incompetent leader for a war with Great
Britain. He was entirely too timid to have
embarked on such a venture of his own accord,
and was simply forced into it by the threat of
losing his second term. The fiery young Democrats
of the South and West, and their brothers
of the Middle States, were the authors of
the war; they themselves, for all their bluster,
were but one shade less incompetent than
their nominal chief, when it came to actual
work, and were shamefully unable to make
their words good by deeds.</p>

<p>The administration thus drifted into a war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
which it had neither the wisdom to avoid, nor
the forethought to prepare for. In view of the
fact that the war was their own, it is impossible
to condemn sufficiently strongly the incredible
folly of the Democrats in having all along
refused to build a navy or provide any other
adequate means of defense. In accordance with
their curiously foolish theories, they persisted
in relying on that weakest of all weak reeds,
the militia, who promptly ran away every time
they faced a foe in the open. This applied
to all, whether eastern, western, or southern;
the men of the northern states in 1812 and
1813 did as badly as, and no worse than, the
Virginians in 1814. Indeed, one of the good
results of the war was that it did away forever
with all reliance on the old-time militia, the
most expensive and inefficient species of soldiery
that could be invented. During the first
year the monotonous record of humiliations and
defeats was only relieved by the splendid victories
of the navy which the Federalists had
created twelve years previously, and which had
been hurt rather than benefited in the intervening
time. Gradually, however, the people
themselves began to bring out leaders: two,
Jackson and Scott, were really good generals,
under whom our soldiers became able to face
even the English regulars, then the most formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
fighting troops in the world; and it
must be remembered that Jackson won his
fights absolutely unhelped by the administration.
In fact, the government at Washington
does not deserve one shred of credit for any of
the victories we won, although to it we directly
owe the greater number of our defeats.</p>

<p>Granting, however, all that can be said as to
the hopeless inefficiency of the administration,
both in making ready for and in waging the
war, it yet remains true that the war itself was
eminently justifiable, and was of the greatest
service to the nation. We had been bullied by
England and France until we had to fight to
preserve our national self-respect; and we very
properly singled out our chief aggressor, though
it would perhaps have been better still to have
acted on the proposition advanced in Congress,
and to have declared war on both. Although
nominally the peace left things as they had
been, practically we gained our point; and we
certainly came out of the contest with a greatly
increased reputation abroad. In spite of the
ludicrous series of failures which began with
our first attempt to invade Canada, and culminated
at Bladensburg, yet in a succession of contests
on the ocean and the lakes, we shattered
the charmed shield of British naval invincibility;
while on the northern frontier we developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
under Scott and Brown an infantry which, unlike
any of the armies of continental Europe,
was able to meet on equal terms the British infantry
in pitched battle in the open; and at
New Orleans we did what the best of Napoleon's
marshals, backed by the flower of the
French soldiers, had been unable to accomplish
during five years of warfare in Spain, and inflicted
a defeat such as no English army had
suffered during a quarter of a century of unbroken
warfare. Above all, the contest gave
an immense impetus to our national feeling,
and freed our politics forever from any dependence
on those of a foreign power.</p>

<p>The war was distinctly worth fighting, and
resulted in good to the country. The blame
that attaches to Madison and the elder democratic-republican
leaders, as well as to their
younger associates, Clay, Calhoun, and the rest,
who fairly flogged them into action, relates to
their utter failure to make any preparations for
the contest, to their helpless inability to carry
it on, and to the extraordinary weakness and
indecision of their policy throughout; and on
all these points it is hardly possible to visit
them with too unsparing censure.</p>

<p>Yet, grave though these faults were, they
were mild compared to those committed by
Morris and the other ultra-Federalists of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
York and New England. Morris's opposition
to the war led him to the most extravagant
lengths. In his hatred of the opposite party
he lost all loyalty to the nation. He championed
the British view of their right to impress
seamen from our ships; he approved of peace
on the terms they offered, which included a curtailment
of our western frontier, and the erection
along it of independent Indian sovereignties
under British protection. He found space
in his letters to exult over the defeats of Bonaparte,
but could spare no word of praise for our
own victories.</p>

<p>He actually advocated repudiating our war
debt,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> on the ground that it was void, being
founded on a moral wrong; and he wished the
Federalists to make public profession of their
purpose, so that when they should come back
to power, the holders might have no reason to
complain that there had been no warning of
their intention. To Josiah Quincy, on May
15th, he wrote: "Should it be objected, as
it probably will to favor lenders and their
associates, that public faith is pledged, it may
be replied that a pledge wickedly given is not
to be redeemed." He thus advanced the theory
that in a government ruled by parties, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
come into power alternately, any debt could be
repudiated, at any time, if the party in power
happened to disapprove of its originally being
incurred. No greenback demagogue of the
lowest type ever advocated a proposition more
dishonest or more contemptible.</p>

<p>He wrote that he agreed with Pickering that
it was impious to raise taxes for so unjust a
war. He endeavored, fortunately in vain, to
induce Rufus King in the Senate to advocate
the refusal of supplies of every sort, whether of
men or money, for carrying on the war; but
King was far too honorable to turn traitor.
Singularly forgetful of his speeches in the
Senate ten years before, he declared that he
wished that a foreign power might occupy and
people the West, so as, by outside pressure,
to stifle our feuds. He sneered at the words
union and constitution, as being meaningless.
He railed bitterly at the honest and loyal majority
of his fellow-Federalists in New York,
who had professed their devotion to the Union;
and in a letter of April 29th, to Harrison
Gray Otis,&mdash;who was almost as bad as himself,&mdash;he
strongly advocated secession, writing
among other things that he wished the New
York Federalists to declare publicly that "the
Union, being the means of freedom, should be
prized as such, but that the end should not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
sacrificed to the means." By comparing this
with Calhoun's famous toast at the Jefferson
birthday dinner in 1880, "The Union; next to
our liberty the most dear; may we all remember
that it can only be preserved by respecting
the rights of the states and distributing equally
the benefit and the burden of the Union," it
can be seen how completely Morris's utterances
went on all fours with those of the great nullifier.</p>

<p>To Pickering he wrote, on October 17th, 1814:
"I hear every day professions of attachment to
the Union, and declarations as to its importance.
I should be glad to meet with some one who
could tell me what has become of the Union, in
what it consists, and to what useful purpose it
endures." He regarded the dissolution of the
Union to be so nearly an accomplished fact that
the only question was whether the boundary
should be "the Delaware, the Susquehanna, or
the Potomac"; for he thought that New York
would have to go with New England. He nourished
great hopes of the Hartford convention,
which he expected would formally come out for
secession; he wrote Otis that the convention
should declare that the Union was already
broken, and that all that remained to do was
to take action for the preservation of the interests
of the Northeast. He was much chagrined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
when the convention fell under the control of
Cabot and the moderates. As late as January
10, 1815, he wrote that the only proceeding
from which the people of his section would gain
practical benefit would be a "severance of the
Union."</p>

<p>In fact, throughout the war of 1812 he appeared
as the open champion of treason to the
nation, of dishonesty to the nation's creditors,
and of cringing subserviency to a foreign power.
It is as impossible to reconcile his course with
his previous career and teachings as it is to try
to make it square with the rules of statesmanship
and morality. His own conduct affords a
conclusive condemnation of his theories as to
the great inferiority of a government conducted
by the multitude, to a government conducted
by the few who should have riches and education.
Undoubtedly he was one of these few;
he was an exceptionally able man, and a
wealthy one; but he went farther wrong at
this period than the majority of our people&mdash;the
"mob" as he would have contemptuously
called them&mdash;have ever gone at any time; for
though every state in turn, and almost every
statesman, has been wrong upon some issue or
another, yet in the long run the bulk of the
people have always hitherto shown themselves
true to the cause of right. Morris strenuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
insisted upon the need of property being defended
from the masses; yet he advocated repudiation
of the national debt, which he should
have known to be quite as dishonest as the repudiation
of his individual liabilities, and he
was certainly aware that the step is a short one
between refusing to pay a man what <i>ought</i> to
be his and taking away from him what actually
<i>is</i> his.</p>

<p>There were many other Federalist leaders
in the same position as himself, especially in
the three southern New England states, where
the whole Federalist party laid itself open to
the gravest charges of disloyalty. Morris was
not alone in his creed at this time. On the
contrary, his position is interesting because it is
typical of that assumed by a large section of his
party throughout the Northeast. In fact, the
Federalists in this portion of the Union had
split in three, although the lines of cleavage
were not always well marked. Many of them
remained heartily loyal to the national idea;
the bulk hesitated as to whether they should go
all lengths or not; while a large and influential
minority, headed by Morris, Pickering, Quincy,
Lowell and others, were avowed disunionists.
Had peace not come when it did, it is probable
that the moderates would finally have fallen
under the control of these ultras. The party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
developed an element of bitter unreason in defeat;
it was a really sad sight to see a body of
able, educated men, interested and skilled in
the conduct of public affairs, all going angrily
and stupidly wrong on the one question that
was of vital concern to the nation.</p>

<p>It is idle to try to justify the proceedings of
the Hartford convention, or of the Massachusetts
and Connecticut legislatures. The decision
to keep the New England troops as an
independent command was of itself sufficient
ground for condemnation; moreover, it was not
warranted by any show of superior prowess on
the part of the New Englanders, for a portion of
Maine continued in possession of the British till
the close of the war. The Hartford resolutions
were so framed as to justify seceding or not seceding
as events turned out; a man like Morris
could extract comfort from them, while it was
hoped they would not frighten those who were
more loyal. The majority of the people in New
England were beyond question loyal, exactly as
in 1860 a majority of Southerners were opposed
to secession; but the disloyal element was active
and resolute, and hoped to force the remainder
into its own way of thinking. It failed signally,
and was buried beneath a load of disgrace;
and New England was taught thus early
and by heart the lesson that wrongs must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
righted within, and not without the Union. It
would have been well for her sister section of
the South, so loyal in 1815, if forty-five years
afterwards she had spared herself the necessity
of learning the same lesson at an infinitely
greater cost.</p>

<p>The truth is that it is nonsense to reproach
any one section with being especially disloyal
to the Union. At one time or another almost
every state has shown strong particularistic
leanings; Connecticut and Pennsylvania, for
example, quite as much as Virginia or Kentucky.
Fortunately the outbursts were never
simultaneous in a majority. It is as impossible
to question the fact that at one period or another
of the past, many of the states in each
section have been very shaky in their allegiance
as it is to doubt that they are now all heartily
loyal. The secession movement of 1860 was
pushed to extremities, instead of being merely
planned and threatened, and the revolt was peculiarly
abhorrent, because of the intention to
make slavery the "corner-stone" of the new
nation, and to reintroduce the slave-trade, to the
certain ultimate ruin of the Southern whites;
but at least it was entirely free from the
meanness of being made in the midst of a
doubtful struggle with a foreign foe. Indeed,
in this respect the ultra-Federalists of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
York and New England in 1814 should be compared
with the infamous Northern copperheads
of the Vallandigham stripe rather than with
the gallant confederates who risked and lost
all in fighting for the cause of their choice.
Half a century before the "stars and bars"
waved over Lee's last intrenchments, perfervid
New England patriots were fond of flaunting
"the flag with five stripes," and drinking to the
health of the&mdash;fortunately stillborn&mdash;new nation.
Later on, the disunion movement among
the Northern abolitionists, headed by Garrison,
was perhaps the most absolutely senseless of all,
for its success meant the immediate abandonment
of every hope of abolition.</p>

<p>In each one of these movements men of
the highest character and capacity took part.
Morris had by previous services rendered the
whole nation his debtor; Garrison was one of
the little band who, in the midst of general
apathy, selfishness, and cowardice, dared to demand
the cutting out of the hideous plague
spot of our civilization; while Lee and Jackson
were as remarkable for stainless purity and
high-mindedness as they were for their consummate
military skill. But the disunion movements
in which they severally took part were
wholly wrong. An Englishman of to-day may
be equally proud of the valor of Cavalier and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Roundhead; but, if competent to judge, he
must admit that the Roundhead was right. So
it is with us. The man who fought for secession
warred for a cause as evil and as capable of
working lasting harm as the doctrine of the
divine right of kings itself. But we may feel
an intense pride in his gallantry; and we may
believe in his honesty as heartily as we believe
in that of the only less foolish being who wishes
to see our government strongly centralized,
heedless of the self-evident fact that over such
a vast land as ours the nation can exist only
as a Federal Union; and that, exactly as the
liberty of the individual and the rights of the
states can only be preserved by upholding the
strength of the nation, so this same localizing
of power in all matters not essentially national
is vital to the wellbeing and durability of the
government.</p>

<p>Besides the honorable men drawn into such
movements there have always been plenty who
took part in or directed them for their own selfish
ends, or whose minds were so warped and
their sense of political morality so crooked as to
make them originate schemes that would have
reduced us to the impotent level of the Spanish-American
republics. These men were peculiar
to neither section. In 1803, Aaron Burr of
New York was undoubtedly anxious to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
about in the Northeast<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> what sixty years later
Jefferson Davis of Mississippi so nearly succeeded
in doing in the South; and the attempt
in the South to make a hero of the one is as
foolish as it would be to make a hero of the
other in the North. If there are such virtues
as loyalty and patriotism, then there must exist
the corresponding crime of treason; if there is
any merit in practicing the first, then there must
be equal demerit in committing the last. Emasculated
sentimentalists may try to strike from
the national dictionary the word treason; but
until that is done, Jefferson Davis must be
deemed guilty thereof.</p>

<p>There are, however, very few of our statesmen
whose characters can be painted in simple,
uniform colors, like Washington and Lincoln
on the one hand, or Burr and Davis on the
other. Nor is Morris one of these few. His
place is alongside of men like Madison, Samuel
Adams, and Patrick Henry, who did the nation
great service at times, but each of whom, at
some one or two critical junctures, ranged himself
with the forces of disorder.</p>

<p>After the peace Morris accommodated himself
to the altered condition with his usual buoyant
cheerfulness; he was too light-hearted, and, to
say the truth, had too good an opinion of himself,
to be cast down even by the signal failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
of his expectations and the memory of the by
no means creditable part he had played. Besides,
he had the great virtue of always good-humoredly
yielding to the inevitable. He
heartily wished the country well, and kept up
a constant correspondence with men high in
influence at Washington. He disliked the
tariff bill of 1816; he did not believe in duties
or imposts, favoring internal, although not direct,
taxation. He was sharp-sighted enough
to see that the Federal party had shot its bolt
and outlived its usefulness, and that it was time
for it to dissolve. To a number of Federalists
at Philadelphia, who wished to continue the
organization, he wrote strongly advising them
to give up the idea, and adding some very sound
and patriotic counsel. "Let us forget party
and think of our country. That country embraces
both parties. We must endeavor, therefore,
to save and benefit both. This cannot be
effected while political delusions array good
men against each other. If you abandon the
contest, the voice of reason, now drowned in
factious vociferation, will be listened to and
heard. The pressure of distress will accelerate
the moment of reflection; and when it arrives
the people will look out for men of sense, experience,
and integrity. Such men may, I trust,
be found in both parties; and if our country be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
delivered, what does it signify whether those
who operate her salvation wear a federal or
democratic cloak?" These words formed almost
his last public utterance, for they were
penned but a couple of months before his death;
and he might well be content to let them
stand as a fit closing to his public career.</p>

<p>He died November 6, 1816, when sixty-four
years old, after a short illness. He had suffered
at intervals for a long time from gout;
but he had enjoyed general good health, as his
erect, commanding, well-built figure showed;
for he was a tall and handsome man. He was
buried on his own estate at Morrisania.</p>

<p>There has never been an American statesman
of keener intellect or more brilliant genius.
Had he possessed but a little more steadiness
and self-control he would have stood among the
two or three very foremost. He was gallant
and fearless. He was absolutely upright and
truthful; the least suggestion of falsehood was
abhorrent to him. His extreme, aggressive
frankness, joined to a certain imperiousness of
disposition, made it difficult for him to get
along well with many of the men with whom
he was thrown in contact. In politics he was
too much of a free lance ever to stand very
high as a leader. He was very generous and
hospitable; he was witty and humorous, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
charming companion, and extremely fond of
good living. He had a proud, almost hasty
temper, and was quick to resent an insult. He
was strictly just; and he made open war on all
traits that displeased him, especially meanness
and hypocrisy. He was essentially a strong
man, and he was an American through and
through.</p>

<p>Perhaps his greatest interest for us lies in the
fact that he was a shrewder, more far-seeing
observer and recorder of contemporary men and
events, both at home and abroad, than any
other American or foreign statesman of his
time. But aside from this he did much lasting
work. He took a most prominent part in bringing
about the independence of the colonies, and
afterwards in welding them into a single powerful
nation, whose greatness he both foresaw and
foretold. He made the final draft of the United
States Constitution; he first outlined our present
system of national coinage; he originated
and got under way the plan for the Erie Canal;
as minister to France he successfully performed
the most difficult task ever allotted to an American
representative at a foreign capital. With
all his faults, there are few men of his generation
to whom the country owes more than to
Gouverneur Morris.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The habit of constantly importing indentured Irish servants,
as well as German laborers, under contract, prevailed
throughout the colonies; and the number of men thus imported
was quite sufficient to form a considerable element in
the population, and to add a new, although perhaps not very
valuable, strain to our already mixed blood. In taking up at
random the file of the <i>New York Gazette</i> for 1766, we find
among the advertisements many offering rewards for runaway
servants; such as "three pounds for the runaway servant Conner
O'Rourke," "ten pounds for the runaway Irish servant,
Philip Maginnis," "five pounds apiece for certain runaway
German miners&mdash;Bruderlein, Baum, Ostmann, etc.&mdash;imported
under contract;" all this mixed in with advertisements of
rewards of about the same money value for "the mulatto man
named Tom," or the "negroes Nero and Pompey." Still, in
speaking of the revolutionary armies, the word "Irish" must
almost always be understood as meaning Presbyterian Irish;
the Catholic Irish had but little hand in the war, and that little
was limited to furnishing soldiers to some of the British
regiments. The Presbyterian Irish, however, in the revolutionary
armies, played a part as manful and valiant as, and
even more important than, that taken by the Catholic Irish
soldiers who served so bravely during the great contest between
the North and South. The few free Catholic Irish
already in America in 1776 were for the most part heartily
loyal; but they were not numerous enough to be of the least
consequence.</p>

<h2><a name="CRITICAL_NOTICES" id="CRITICAL_NOTICES">CRITICAL NOTICES.</a></h2>

<p><i>JOHN QUINCY ADAMS</i>. That Mr. Morse's conclusions
will in the main
be those of posterity we have very little doubt, and he has set an
admirable example to his coadjutors in respect of interesting
narrative, just proportion, and judicial candor.&mdash;<i>New York
Evening Post</i>.</p>

<p><i>HAMILTON</i>. The biography of Mr. Lodge is calm and
dignified throughout. He has the virtue&mdash;rare
indeed among biographers&mdash;of impartiality. He has
done his work with conscientious care, and the biography of
Hamilton is a book which cannot have too many readers. It is
more than a biography; it is a study in the science of government.&mdash;<i>St.
Paul Pioneer-Press</i>.</p>

<p><i>CALHOUN</i>. Nothing can exceed the skill with which the
political career of the great South Carolinian
is portrayed in these pages. The work is superior to any other
number of the series thus far, and we do not think it can be surpassed
by any of those that are to come. The whole discussion
in relation to Calhoun's position is eminently philosophical and
just.&mdash;<i>The Dial</i> (Chicago).</p>

<p><i>JACKSON</i>. Professor Sumner has ... all in all, made
the justest long estimate of Jackson that has
had itself put between the covers of a book.&mdash;<i>New York
Times</i>.</p>

<p><i>RANDOLPH</i>. The book has been to me intensely interesting....
It is rich in new facts and side
lights, and is worthy of its place in the already brilliant series
of monographs on American Statesmen.&mdash;Prof. <span class="smcap">Moses Coit
Tyler</span>.</p>

<p><i>MONROE</i>. In clearness of style, and in all points of literary
workmanship, from cover to cover, the
volume is well-nigh perfect. There are also a calmness of judgment,
a correctness of taste, and an absence of partisanship
which are too frequently wanting in biographies, and especially
in political biographies.&mdash;<i>American Literary Churchman</i> (Baltimore).</p>

<p><i>JEFFERSON</i>. The book is exceedingly interesting and
readable. The attention of the reader is
strongly seized at once, and he is carried along in spite of himself,
sometimes protesting, sometimes doubting, yet unable to
lay the book down.&mdash;<i>Chicago Standard</i>.</p>

<p><i>WEBSTER</i>. It will be read by students of history; it will
be invaluable as a work of reference; it
will be an authority as regards matters of fact and criticism; it
hits the keynote of Webster's durable and ever-growing fame;
it is adequate, calm, impartial; it is admirable.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Press</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
<i>GALLATIN</i>. It is one of the most carefully prepared of
these very valuable volumes, ... abounding
in information not so readily accessible as is that pertaining
to men more often treated by the biographer.... The whole
work covers a ground which the political student cannot afford
to neglect.&mdash;<i>Boston Correspondent Hartford Courant</i>.</p>

<p><i>MADISON</i>. The execution of the work deserves the highest
praise. It is very readable, in a bright
and vigorous style, and is marked by unity and consecutiveness
of plan.&mdash;<i>The Nation</i> (New York).</p>

<p><i>JOHN ADAMS</i>. A good piece of literary work.... It
covers the ground thoroughly, and
gives just the sort of simple and succinct account that is wanted.&mdash;<i>Evening
Post</i> (New York).</p>

<p><i>MARSHALL</i>. Well done, with simplicity, clearness, precision,
and judgment, and in a spirit of
moderation and equity. A valuable addition to the series.&mdash;<i>New
York Tribune</i>.</p>

<p><i>SAMUEL ADAMS</i>. Thoroughly appreciative and sympathetic,
yet fair and critical....
This biography is a piece of good work&mdash;a clear and simple
presentation of a noble man and pure patriot; it is written in a
spirit of candor and humanity.&mdash;<i>Worcester Spy</i>.</p>

<p><i>BENTON</i>. An interesting addition to our political literature,
and will be of great service if it spread
an admiration for that austere public morality which was one of
the marked characteristics of its chief figure.&mdash;<i>The Epoch</i>
(New York).</p>

<p><i>CLAY</i>. We have in this life of Henry Clay a biography of
one of the most distinguished of American statesmen,
and a political history of the United States for the first
half of the nineteenth century. In each of these important and
difficult undertakings, Mr. Schurz has been eminently successful.
Indeed, it is not too much to say that, for the period covered,
we have no other book which equals or begins to equal this life
of Henry Clay as an introduction to the study of American politics.&mdash;<i>Political
Science Quarterly</i> (New York).</p>

<p><i>HENRY</i>. Professor Tyler has not only made one of the
best and most readable of American biographies;
he may fairly be said to have reconstructed the life of Patrick
Henry, and to have vindicated the memory of that great man
from the unappreciative and injurious estimate which has been
placed upon it.&mdash;<i>New York Evening Post</i>.</p>

<p><i>MORRIS</i>. Mr. Roosevelt has produced an animated and
intensely interesting biographical volume....
Mr. Roosevelt never loses sight of the picturesque background
of politics, war-governments, and diplomacy.&mdash;<i>Magazine of
American History</i> (New York).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
<i>VAN BUREN</i>. No more generous, appreciative, or just
biography, and no more interesting or
philosophical piece of political history has appeared in this valuable
series ... than this absorbing book.... To give any adequate
idea of the personal interest of the book, or its intimate
bearing on nearly the whole course of our political history would
be equivalent to quoting the larger part of it.&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>.</p>

<p><i>WASHINGTON</i>. Mr. Lodge has written an admirable
biography, and one which cannot but
confirm the American people in the prevailing estimate concerning
the Father of his Country; but its deepest and most important
significance appears to us to consist in its testimony to the
exaltation and the uniqueness of a character whose like comes
seldom to the world, and only in periods of great stress and crisis.&mdash;<i>New
York Tribune</i>.</p>

<p><i>FRANKLIN</i>. He has managed to condense the whole
mass of matter gleaned from all sources
into his volume without losing in a single sentence the freedom
or lightness of his style or giving his book in any part the
crowded look of an epitome. He has plenty of time and plenty

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
